<p>Now that we have an evaluator expressed as a Lisp program, we can experiment
with alternative choices in language design simply by modifying the evaluator.
Indeed, new languages are often invented by first writing an evaluator that
embeds the new language within an existing high-level language.  For example,
if we wish to discuss some aspect of a proposed modification to Lisp with
another member of the Lisp community, we can supply an evaluator that embodies
the change.  The recipient can then experiment with the new evaluator and send
back comments as further modifications.  Not only does the high-level
implementation base make it easier to test and debug the evaluator; in
addition, the embedding enables the designer to snarf<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF235" href="#FOOT235"><sup>235</sup></a>
features from the underlying language, just as our embedded Lisp evaluator uses
primitives and control structure from the underlying Lisp.  Only later (if
ever) need the designer go to the trouble of building a complete implementation
in a low-level language or in hardware.  In this section and the next we
explore some variations on Scheme that provide significant additional
expressive power.

<span id="g_t4_002e2_002e1"></span><span id="Normal-Order-and-Applicative-Order"></span><h4 class="subsection"><span class="secnum">4.2.1</span><span class="sectitle">Normal Order and Applicative Order</span></h4>

<p>In <a href="1_002e1.html#g_t1_002e1">1.1</a>, where we began our discussion of models of evaluation, we
noted that Scheme is an <span id="index-applicative_002dorder"></span>
<em>applicative-order</em> language, namely, that all
the arguments to Scheme procedures are evaluated when the procedure is applied.
In contrast, <span id="index-normal_002dorder"></span>
<em>normal-order</em> languages delay evaluation of procedure
arguments until the actual argument values are needed.  Delaying evaluation of
procedure arguments until the last possible moment (e.g., until they are
required by a primitive operation) is called <span id="index-lazy-evaluation"></span>
<em>lazy evaluation</em>.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF236" href="#FOOT236"><sup>236</sup></a>  Consider the procedure
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (try a b)
  (if (= a 0) 1 b))
</pre></div>

<p>Evaluating <code>(try 0 (/ 1 0))</code> generates an error in Scheme.  With lazy
evaluation, there would be no error.  Evaluating the expression would return 1,
because the argument <code>(/ 1 0)</code> would never be evaluated.
</p>
<p>An example that exploits lazy evaluation is the definition of a procedure
<code>unless</code>
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (unless condition 
                usual-value 
                exceptional-value)
  (if condition 
      exceptional-value 
      usual-value))
</pre></div>

<p>that can be used in expressions such as
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(unless (= b 0)
        (/ a b)
        (begin 
          (display &quot;exception: returning 0&quot;)
          0))
</pre></div>

<p>This won&rsquo;t work in an applicative-order language because both the usual value
and the exceptional value will be evaluated before <code>unless</code> is called
(compare <a href="1_002e1.html#Exercise-1_002e6">Exercise 1.6</a>).  An advantage of lazy evaluation is that some
procedures, such as <code>unless</code>, can do useful computation even if evaluation
of some of their arguments would produce errors or would not terminate.
</p>
<p>If the body of a procedure is entered before an argument has been evaluated we
say that the procedure is <span id="index-non_002dstrict"></span>
<em>non-strict</em> in that argument.  If the
argument is evaluated before the body of the procedure is entered we say that
the procedure is <span id="index-strict"></span>
<em>strict</em> in that argument.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF237" href="#FOOT237"><sup>237</sup></a>  In a purely applicative-order
language, all procedures are strict in each argument.  In a purely normal-order
language, all compound procedures are non-strict in each argument, and
primitive procedures may be either strict or non-strict.  There are also
languages (see <a href="#Exercise-4_002e31">Exercise 4.31</a>) that give programmers detailed control over
the strictness of the procedures they define.
</p>
<p>A striking example of a procedure that can usefully be made non-strict is
<code>cons</code> (or, in general, almost any constructor for data structures).  One
can do useful computation, combining elements to form data structures and
operating on the resulting data structures, even if the values of the elements
are not known.  It makes perfect sense, for instance, to compute the length of
a list without knowing the values of the individual elements in the list.  We
will exploit this idea in <a href="#g_t4_002e2_002e3">4.2.3</a> to implement the streams of
<a href="Chapter-3.html">Chapter 3</a> as lists formed of non-strict <code>cons</code> pairs.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><span id="Exercise-4_002e25"></span>Exercise 4.25:</strong> Suppose that (in ordinary
applicative-order Scheme) we define <code>unless</code> as shown above and then
define <code>factorial</code> in terms of <code>unless</code> as
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (factorial n)
  (unless (= n 1)
          (* n (factorial (- n 1)))
          1))
</pre></div>

<p>What happens if we attempt to evaluate <code>(factorial 5)</code>?  Will our
definitions work in a normal-order language?
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><span id="Exercise-4_002e26"></span>Exercise 4.26:</strong> Ben Bitdiddle and Alyssa
P. Hacker disagree over the importance of lazy evaluation for implementing
things such as <code>unless</code>.  Ben points out that it&rsquo;s possible to implement
<code>unless</code> in applicative order as a special form.  Alyssa counters that, if
one did that, <code>unless</code> would be merely syntax, not a procedure that could
be used in conjunction with higher-order procedures.  Fill in the details on
both sides of the argument.  Show how to implement <code>unless</code> as a derived
expression (like <code>cond</code> or <code>let</code>), and give an example of a situation
where it might be useful to have <code>unless</code> available as a procedure, rather
than as a special form.

<p>In this section we will implement a normal-order language that is the same as
Scheme except that compound procedures are non-strict in each argument.
Primitive procedures will still be strict.  It is not difficult to modify the
evaluator of <a href="4_002e1.html#g_t4_002e1_002e1">4.1.1</a> so that the language it interprets behaves
this way.  Almost all the required changes center around procedure application.
</p>
<p>The basic idea is that, when applying a procedure, the interpreter must
determine which arguments are to be evaluated and which are to be delayed.  The
delayed arguments are not evaluated; instead, they are transformed into objects
called <span id="index-thunks"></span>
<em>thunks</em>.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF238" href="#FOOT238"><sup>238</sup></a> The thunk must
contain the information required to produce the value of the argument when it
is needed, as if it had been evaluated at the time of the application.  Thus,
the thunk must contain the argument expression and the environment in which the
procedure application is being evaluated.
</p>
<p>The process of evaluating the expression in a thunk is called
<span id="index-forcing"></span>
<em>forcing</em>.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF239" href="#FOOT239"><sup>239</sup></a>
In general, a thunk will be forced only when its value is needed: when it is
passed to a primitive procedure that will use the value of the thunk; when it
is the value of a predicate of a conditional; and when it is the value of an
operator that is about to be applied as a procedure.  One design choice we have
available is whether or not to <span id="index-memoize"></span>
<em>memoize</em> thunks, as we did with delayed
objects in <a href="3_002e5.html#g_t3_002e5_002e1">3.5.1</a>.  With memoization, the first time a thunk is
forced, it stores the value that is computed.  Subsequent forcings simply
return the stored value without repeating the computation.  We&rsquo;ll make our
interpreter memoize, because this is more efficient for many applications.
There are tricky considerations here, however.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF240" href="#FOOT240"><sup>240</sup></a>
</p>
<span id="Modifying-the-evaluator"></span><h4 class="subsubheading">Modifying the evaluator</h4>

<p>The main difference between the lazy evaluator and the one in <a href="4_002e1.html#g_t4_002e1">4.1</a>
is in the handling of procedure applications in <code>eval</code> and <code>apply</code>.
</p>
<p>The <code>application?</code> clause of <code>eval</code> becomes
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">((application? exp)
 (apply (actual-value (operator exp) env)
        (operands exp)
        env))
</pre></div>

<p>This is almost the same as the <code>application?</code> clause of <code>eval</code> in
<a href="4_002e1.html#g_t4_002e1_002e1">4.1.1</a>.  For lazy evaluation, however, we call <code>apply</code> with
the operand expressions, rather than the arguments produced by evaluating them.
Since we will need the environment to construct thunks if the arguments are to
be delayed, we must pass this as well.  We still evaluate the operator, because
<code>apply</code> needs the actual procedure to be applied in order to dispatch on
its type (primitive versus compound) and apply it.
</p>
<p>Whenever we need the actual value of an expression, we use
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (actual-value exp env)
  (force-it (eval exp env)))
</pre></div>

<p>instead of just <code>eval</code>, so that if the expression&rsquo;s value is a thunk, it
will be forced.
</p>
<p>Our new version of <code>apply</code> is also almost the same as the version in
<a href="4_002e1.html#g_t4_002e1_002e1">4.1.1</a>.  The difference is that <code>eval</code> has passed in
unevaluated operand expressions: For primitive procedures (which are strict),
we evaluate all the arguments before applying the primitive; for compound
procedures (which are non-strict) we delay all the arguments before applying
the procedure.
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (apply procedure arguments env)
  (cond ((primitive-procedure? procedure)
         (apply-primitive-procedure
          procedure
          (list-of-arg-values 
           arguments 
           env)))  <span class="roman">; changed</span>
        ((compound-procedure? procedure)
         (eval-sequence
          (procedure-body procedure)
          (extend-environment
           (procedure-parameters procedure)
           (list-of-delayed-args 
            arguments 
            env)   <span class="roman">; changed</span>
           (procedure-environment procedure))))
        (else (error &quot;Unknown procedure 
                      type: APPLY&quot; 
                     procedure))))
</pre></div>

<p>The procedures that process the arguments are just like <code>list-of-values</code>
from <a href="4_002e1.html#g_t4_002e1_002e1">4.1.1</a>, except that <code>list-of-delayed-args</code> delays the
arguments instead of evaluating them, and <code>list-of-arg-values</code> uses
<code>actual-value</code> instead of <code>eval</code>:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (list-of-arg-values exps env)
  (if (no-operands? exps)
      '()
      (cons (actual-value 
             (first-operand exps) 
             env)
            (list-of-arg-values 
             (rest-operands exps)
             env))))

(define (list-of-delayed-args exps env)
  (if (no-operands? exps)
      '()
      (cons (delay-it 
             (first-operand exps) 
             env)
            (list-of-delayed-args 
             (rest-operands exps)
             env))))
</pre></div>

<p>The other place we must change the evaluator is in the handling of <code>if</code>,
where we must use <code>actual-value</code> instead of <code>eval</code> to get the value
of the predicate expression before testing whether it is true or false:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (eval-if exp env)
  (if (true? (actual-value (if-predicate exp) 
                           env))
      (eval (if-consequent exp) env)
      (eval (if-alternative exp) env)))
</pre></div>

<p>Finally, we must change the <code>driver-loop</code> procedure (<a href="4_002e1.html#g_t4_002e1_002e4">4.1.4</a>)
to use <code>actual-value</code> instead of <code>eval</code>, so that if a delayed value
is propagated back to the read-eval-print loop, it will be forced before being
printed.  We also change the prompts to indicate that this is the lazy
evaluator:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define input-prompt  &quot;;;; L-Eval input:&quot;)
(define output-prompt &quot;;;; L-Eval value:&quot;)

(define (driver-loop)
  (prompt-for-input input-prompt)
  (let ((input (read)))
    (let ((output (actual-value 
                   input 
                   the-global-environment)))
      (announce-output output-prompt)
      (user-print output)))
  (driver-loop))
</pre></div>

<p>With these changes made, we can start the evaluator and test it.  The
successful evaluation of the <code>try</code> expression discussed in 
<a href="#g_t4_002e2_002e1">4.2.1</a> indicates that the interpreter is performing lazy evaluation:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define the-global-environment 
  (setup-environment))

(driver-loop)

<i>;;; L-Eval input:</i>
(define (try a b) (if (= a 0) 1 b))

<i>;;; L-Eval value:</i>
<i>ok</i>

<i>;;; L-Eval input:</i>
(try 0 (/ 1 0))

<i>;;; L-Eval value:</i>
<i>1</i>
</pre></div>

<span id="Representing-thunks"></span><h4 class="subsubheading">Representing thunks</h4>

<p>Our evaluator must arrange to create thunks when procedures are applied to
arguments and to force these thunks later.  A thunk must package an expression
together with the environment, so that the argument can be produced later.  To
force the thunk, we simply extract the expression and environment from the
thunk and evaluate the expression in the environment.  We use
<code>actual-value</code> rather than <code>eval</code> so that in case the value of the
expression is itself a thunk, we will force that, and so on, until we reach
something that is not a thunk:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (force-it obj)
  (if (thunk? obj)
      (actual-value (thunk-exp obj) 
                    (thunk-env obj))
      obj))
</pre></div>

<p>One easy way to package an expression with an environment is to make a list
containing the expression and the environment.  Thus, we create a thunk as
follows:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (delay-it exp env)
  (list 'thunk exp env))
(define (thunk? obj) (tagged-list? obj 'thunk))
(define (thunk-exp thunk) (cadr thunk))
(define (thunk-env thunk) (caddr thunk))
</pre></div>

<p>Actually, what we want for our interpreter is not quite this, but rather thunks
that have been memoized.  When a thunk is forced, we will turn it into an
evaluated thunk by replacing the stored expression with its value and changing
the <code>thunk</code> tag so that it can be recognized as already
evaluated.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF241" href="#FOOT241"><sup>241</sup></a>
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (evaluated-thunk? obj)
  (tagged-list? obj 'evaluated-thunk))

(define (thunk-value evaluated-thunk) 
  (cadr evaluated-thunk))

(define (force-it obj)
  (cond ((thunk? obj)
         (let ((result
                (actual-value 
                 (thunk-exp obj)
                 (thunk-env obj))))
           (set-car! obj 'evaluated-thunk)
           ;; <span class="roman">replace <code>exp</code> with its value:</span>
           (set-car! (cdr obj) result) 
           ;; <span class="roman">forget unneeded <code>env</code>:</span>
           (set-cdr! (cdr obj) '()) 
           result))
        ((evaluated-thunk? obj)
         (thunk-value obj))
        (else obj)))
</pre></div>

<p>Notice that the same <code>delay-it</code> procedure works both with and without
memoization.

<blockquote>
<p><strong><span id="Exercise-4_002e30"></span>Exercise 4.30:</strong> Cy D. Fect, a reformed C
programmer, is worried that some side effects may never take place, because the
lazy evaluator doesn&rsquo;t force the expressions in a sequence.  Since the value of
an expression in a sequence other than the last one is not used (the expression
is there only for its effect, such as assigning to a variable or printing),
there can be no subsequent use of this value (e.g., as an argument to a
primitive procedure) that will cause it to be forced.  Cy thus thinks that when
evaluating sequences, we must force all expressions in the sequence except the
final one.  He proposes to modify <code>eval-sequence</code> from <a href="4_002e1.html#g_t4_002e1_002e1">4.1.1</a>
to use <code>actual-value</code> rather than <code>eval</code>:

<p>Explain why Ben is right about the behavior of <code>for-each</code>.
</p>
</li><li> Cy agrees that Ben is right about the <code>for-each</code> example, but says that
that&rsquo;s not the kind of program he was thinking about when he proposed his
change to <code>eval-sequence</code>.  He defines the following two procedures in the
lazy evaluator:

<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (p1 x)
  (set! x (cons x '(2))) x)

(define (p2 x)
  (define (p e) e x)
  (p (set! x (cons x '(2)))))
</pre></div>

<p>What are the values of <code>(p1 1)</code> and <code>(p2 1)</code> with the original
<code>eval-sequence</code>?  What would the values be with Cy&rsquo;s proposed change to
<code>eval-sequence</code>?
</p>
</li><li> Cy also points out that changing <code>eval-sequence</code> as he proposes does not
affect the behavior of the example in part a.  Explain why this is true.

</li><li> How do you think sequences ought to be treated in the lazy evaluator?  Do you
like Cy&rsquo;s approach, the approach in the text, or some other approach?

<p><strong><span id="Exercise-4_002e31"></span>Exercise 4.31:</strong> The approach taken in this
section is somewhat unpleasant, because it makes an incompatible change to
Scheme.  It might be nicer to implement lazy evaluation as an
<span id="index-upward_002dcompatible-extension"></span>
<em>upward-compatible extension</em>, that is, so that ordinary Scheme
programs will work as before.  We can do this by extending the syntax of
procedure declarations to let the user control whether or not arguments are to
be delayed.  While we&rsquo;re at it, we may as well also give the user the choice
between delaying with and without memoization.  For example, the definition
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (f a (b lazy) c (d lazy-memo))
  <span class="roman">…</span>)
</pre></div>

<p>would define <code>f</code> to be a procedure of four arguments, where the first and
third arguments are evaluated when the procedure is called, the second argument
is delayed, and the fourth argument is both delayed and memoized.  Thus,
ordinary procedure definitions will produce the same behavior as ordinary
Scheme, while adding the <code>lazy-memo</code> declaration to each parameter of
every compound procedure will produce the behavior of the lazy evaluator
defined in this section. Design and implement the changes required to produce
such an extension to Scheme.  You will have to implement new syntax procedures
to handle the new syntax for <code>define</code>.  You must also arrange for
<code>eval</code> or <code>apply</code> to determine when arguments are to be delayed, and
to force or delay arguments accordingly, and you must arrange for forcing to
memoize or not, as appropriate.

<p>In <a href="3_002e5.html#g_t3_002e5_002e1">3.5.1</a>, we showed how to implement streams as delayed lists.
We introduced special forms <code>delay</code> and <code>cons-stream</code>, which allowed
us to construct a &ldquo;promise&rdquo; to compute the <code>cdr</code> of a stream, without
actually fulfilling that promise until later.  We could use this general
technique of introducing special forms whenever we need more control over the
evaluation process, but this is awkward.  For one thing, a special form is not
a first-class object like a procedure, so we cannot use it together with
higher-order procedures.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF243" href="#FOOT243"><sup>243</sup></a>  Additionally, we were
forced to create streams as a new kind of data object similar but not identical
to lists, and this required us to reimplement many ordinary list operations
(<code>map</code>, <code>append</code>, and so on) for use with streams.
</p>
<p>With lazy evaluation, streams and lists can be identical, so there is no need
for special forms or for separate list and stream operations.  All we need to
do is to arrange matters so that <code>cons</code> is non-strict.  One way to
accomplish this is to extend the lazy evaluator to allow for non-strict
primitives, and to implement <code>cons</code> as one of these.  An easier way is to
recall (<a href="2_002e1.html#g_t2_002e1_002e3">2.1.3</a>) that there is no fundamental need to implement
<code>cons</code> as a primitive at all.  Instead, we can represent pairs as
procedures:<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF244" href="#FOOT244"><sup>244</sup></a>
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (cons x y) (lambda (m) (m x y)))
(define (car z) (z (lambda (p q) p)))
(define (cdr z) (z (lambda (p q) q)))
</pre></div>

<p>In terms of these basic operations, the standard definitions of the list
operations will work with infinite lists (streams) as well as finite ones, and
the stream operations can be implemented as list operations.  Here are some
examples:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (list-ref items n)
  (if (= n 0)
      (car items)
      (list-ref (cdr items) (- n 1))))

(define (map proc items)
  (if (null? items)
      '()
      (cons (proc (car items))
            (map proc (cdr items)))))

(define (scale-list items factor)
  (map (lambda (x) (* x factor))
       items))

(define (add-lists list1 list2)
  (cond ((null? list1) list2)
        ((null? list2) list1)
        (else (cons (+ (car list1) 
                       (car list2))
                    (add-lists
                     (cdr list1) 
                     (cdr list2))))))

(define ones (cons 1 ones))

(define integers 
  (cons 1 (add-lists ones integers)))

<i>;;; L-Eval input:</i>
(list-ref integers 17)

<i>;;; L-Eval value:</i>
<i>18</i>
</pre></div>

<p>Note that these lazy lists are even lazier than the streams of <a href="Chapter-3.html">Chapter 3</a>:
The <code>car</code> of the list, as well as the <code>cdr</code>, is
delayed.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF245" href="#FOOT245"><sup>245</sup></a>  In fact, even accessing the <code>car</code> or
<code>cdr</code> of a lazy pair need not force the value of a list element.  The
value will be forced only when it is really needed&mdash;e.g., for use as the
argument of a primitive, or to be printed as an answer.
</p>
<p>Lazy pairs also help with the problem that arose with streams in 
<a href="3_002e5.html#g_t3_002e5_002e4">3.5.4</a>, where we found that formulating stream models of systems with
loops may require us to sprinkle our programs with explicit <code>delay</code>
operations, beyond the ones supplied by <code>cons-stream</code>.  With lazy
evaluation, all arguments to procedures are delayed uniformly.  For instance,
we can implement procedures to integrate lists and solve differential equations
as we originally intended in <a href="3_002e5.html#g_t3_002e5_002e4">3.5.4</a>:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (integral integrand initial-value dt)
  (define int
    (cons initial-value
          (add-lists (scale-list integrand dt) 
                     int)))
  int)

(define (solve f y0 dt)
  (define y (integral dy y0 dt))
  (define dy (map f y))
  y)

The difference 
between the &ldquo;lazy&rdquo; terminology and the
&ldquo;normal-order&rdquo; terminology is somewhat fuzzy.  Generally, &ldquo;lazy&rdquo; refers to
the mechanisms of particular evaluators, while &ldquo;normal-order&rdquo; refers to the
semantics of languages, independent of any particular evaluation strategy.  But
this is not a hard-and-fast distinction, and the two terminologies are often
used interchangeably.</p>

<div id="FOOT237"><p><a class="footnote_backlink" href="#DOCF237"><sup>237</sup></a>
The &ldquo;strict&rdquo;
versus &ldquo;non-strict&rdquo; terminology means essentially the same thing as
&ldquo;applicative-order&rdquo; versus &ldquo;normal-order,&rdquo; except that it refers to
individual procedures and arguments rather than to the language as a whole.  At
a conference on programming languages you might hear someone say, &ldquo;The
normal-order language Hassle has certain strict primitives.  Other procedures
take their arguments by lazy evaluation.&rdquo;</p>

The word <span id="index-thunk"></span>
<em>thunk</em> was invented by an
informal working group that was discussing the implementation of call-by-name
in Algol 60.  They observed that most of the analysis of (&ldquo;thinking about&rdquo;)
the expression could be done at compile time; thus, at run time, the expression
would already have been &ldquo;thunk&rdquo; about (<a href="References.html#Ingerman-et-al_002e-1960">Ingerman et al. 1960</a>).</p>

This is analogous to the use of <code>force</code> on the
delayed objects that were introduced in <a href="Chapter-3.html">Chapter 3</a> to represent streams.
The critical difference between what we are doing here and what we did in
<a href="Chapter-3.html">Chapter 3</a> is that we are building delaying and forcing into the
evaluator, and thus making this uniform and automatic throughout the language.</p>

Lazy evaluation
combined with memoization is sometimes referred to as <span id="index-call_002dby_002dneed-1"></span>
<em>call-by-need</em>
argument passing, in contrast to <span id="index-call_002dby_002dname-1"></span>
<em>call-by-name</em> argument passing.
(Call-by-name, introduced in Algol 60, is similar to non-memoized lazy
evaluation.)  As language designers, we can build our evaluator to memoize, not
to memoize, or leave this an option for programmers (<a href="#Exercise-4_002e31">Exercise 4.31</a>).  As
you might expect from <a href="Chapter-3.html">Chapter 3</a>, these choices raise issues that become
both subtle and confusing in the presence of assignments.  (See <a href="#Exercise-4_002e27">Exercise 4.27</a> 
and <a href="#Exercise-4_002e29">Exercise 4.29</a>.)  An excellent article by <a href="References.html#Clinger-_00281982_0029">Clinger (1982)</a>
attempts to clarify the multiple dimensions of confusion that arise here.</p>

Notice that we also erase the <code>env</code> from the thunk
once the expression&rsquo;s value has been computed.  This makes no difference in the
values returned by the interpreter.  It does help save space, however, because
removing the reference from the thunk to the <code>env</code> once it is no longer
needed allows this structure to be <span id="index-garbage_002dcollected"></span>
<em>garbage-collected</em> and its space
recycled, as we will discuss in <a href="5_002e3.html#g_t5_002e3">5.3</a>.
</p>
<p>Similarly, we could have allowed unneeded environments in the memoized delayed
objects of <a href="3_002e5.html#g_t3_002e5_002e1">3.5.1</a> to be garbage-collected, by having
<code>memo-proc</code> do something like <code>(set! proc '())</code> to discard the
procedure <code>proc</code> (which includes the environment in which the <code>delay</code>
was evaluated) after storing its value.</p>

<div id="FOOT242"><p><a class="footnote_backlink" href="#DOCF242"><sup>242</sup></a>
This exercise demonstrates that the interaction between
lazy evaluation and side effects can be very confusing.  This is just what you
might expect from the discussion in <a href="Chapter-3.html">Chapter 3</a>.</p>

This is the procedural representation described in
<a href="2_002e1.html#Exercise-2_002e4">Exercise 2.4</a>.  Essentially any procedural representation (e.g., a
message-passing implementation) would do as well.  Notice that we can install
these definitions in the lazy evaluator simply by typing them at the driver
loop.  If we had originally included <code>cons</code>, <code>car</code>, and <code>cdr</code> as
primitives in the global environment, they will be redefined.  (Also see
