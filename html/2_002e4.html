<span id="Multiple-Representations-for-Abstract-Data"></span><h3 class="section"><span class="secnum">2.4</span><span class="sectitle">Multiple Representations for Abstract Data</span></h3>

<p>We have introduced data abstraction, a methodology for structuring systems in
such a way that much of a program can be specified independent of the choices
involved in implementing the data objects that the program manipulates.  For
example, we saw in <a href="2_002e1.html#g_t2_002e1_002e1">2.1.1</a> how to separate the task of designing a
program that uses rational numbers from the task of implementing rational
numbers in terms of the computer language&rsquo;s primitive mechanisms for
constructing compound data.  The key idea was to erect an abstraction barrier
&ndash; in this case, the selectors and constructors for rational numbers
(<code>make-rat</code>, <code>numer</code>, <code>denom</code>)&mdash;that isolates the way rational
numbers are used from their underlying representation in terms of list
structure.  A similar abstraction barrier isolates the details of the
procedures that perform rational arithmetic (<code>add-rat</code>, <code>sub-rat</code>,
<code>mul-rat</code>, and <code>div-rat</code>) from the &ldquo;higher-level&rdquo; procedures that
use rational numbers.  The resulting program has the structure shown in
<a href="2_002e1.html#Figure-2_002e1">Figure 2.1</a>.
</p>
<p>These data-abstraction barriers are powerful tools for controlling complexity.
By isolating the underlying representations of data objects, we can divide the
task of designing a large program into smaller tasks that can be performed
separately.  But this kind of data abstraction is not yet powerful enough,
because it may not always make sense to speak of &ldquo;the underlying
representation&rdquo; for a data object.
</p>
<p>For one thing, there might be more than one useful representation for a data
object, and we might like to design systems that can deal with multiple
representations.  To take a simple example, complex numbers may be represented
in two almost equivalent ways: in rectangular form (real and imaginary parts)
and in polar form (magnitude and angle).  Sometimes rectangular form is more
appropriate and sometimes polar form is more appropriate.  Indeed, it is
perfectly plausible to imagine a system in which complex numbers are
represented in both ways, and in which the procedures for manipulating complex
numbers work with either representation.
</p>
<p>More importantly, programming systems are often designed by many people working
over extended periods of time, subject to requirements that change over time.
In such an environment, it is simply not possible for everyone to agree in
advance on choices of data representation.  So in addition to the
data-abstraction barriers that isolate representation from use, we need
abstraction barriers that isolate different design choices from each other and
permit different choices to coexist in a single program.  Furthermore, since
large programs are often created by combining pre-existing modules that were
designed in isolation, we need conventions that permit programmers to
incorporate modules into larger systems <span id="index-additively-1"></span>
<em>additively</em>, that is, without
having to redesign or reimplement these modules.
</p>
<p>In this section, we will learn how to cope with data that may be represented in
different ways by different parts of a program.  This requires constructing
<span id="index-generic-procedures-1"></span>
<em>generic procedures</em>&mdash;procedures that can operate on data that may be
represented in more than one way.  Our main technique for building generic
procedures will be to work in terms of data objects that have <span id="index-type-tags"></span>
<em>type tags</em>, 
that is, data objects that include explicit information about how they
are to be processed.  We will also discuss <span id="index-data_002ddirected"></span>
<em>data-directed</em> programming,
a powerful and convenient implementation strategy for additively assembling
systems with generic operations.
</p>
<p>We begin with the simple complex-number example. We will see how type tags and
data-directed style enable us to design separate rectangular and polar
representations for complex numbers while maintaining the notion of an abstract
&ldquo;complex-number&rdquo; data object.  We will accomplish this by defining arithmetic
procedures for complex numbers (<code>add-complex</code>, <code>sub-complex</code>,
<code>mul-complex</code>, and <code>div-complex</code>) in terms of generic selectors that
access parts of a complex number independent of how the number is represented.
The resulting complex-number system, as shown in <a href="#Figure-2_002e19">Figure 2.19</a>, contains
two different kinds of abstraction barriers.  The &ldquo;horizontal&rdquo; abstraction
barriers play the same role as the ones in <a href="2_002e1.html#Figure-2_002e1">Figure 2.1</a>.  They isolate
&ldquo;higher-level&rdquo; operations from &ldquo;lower-level&rdquo; representations.  In addition,
there is a &ldquo;vertical&rdquo; barrier that gives us the ability to separately design
and install alternative representations.

<p>In <a href="2_002e5.html#g_t2_002e5">2.5</a> we will show how to use type tags and data-directed style
to develop a generic arithmetic package.  This provides procedures (<code>add</code>,
<code>mul</code>, and so on) that can be used to manipulate all sorts of &ldquo;numbers&rdquo;
and can be easily extended when a new kind of number is needed.  In 
<a href="2_002e5.html#g_t2_002e5_002e3">2.5.3</a>, we&rsquo;ll show how to use generic arithmetic in a system that performs
symbolic algebra.

<span id="g_t2_002e4_002e1"></span><span id="Representations-for-Complex-Numbers"></span><h4 class="subsection"><span class="secnum">2.4.1</span><span class="sectitle">Representations for Complex Numbers</span></h4>

<p>We will develop a system that performs arithmetic operations on complex numbers
as a simple but unrealistic example of a program that uses generic operations.
We begin by discussing two plausible representations for complex numbers as
ordered pairs: rectangular form (real part and imaginary part) and polar form
(magnitude and angle).<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF109" href="#FOOT109"><sup>109</sup></a>  
Section <a href="#g_t2_002e4_002e2">2.4.2</a> will show how both representations can be made to coexist in a
single system through the use of type tags and generic operations.
</p>
<p>Like rational numbers, complex numbers are naturally represented as ordered
pairs.  The set of complex numbers can be thought of as a two-dimensional space
with two orthogonal axes, the &ldquo;real&rdquo; axis and the &ldquo;imaginary&rdquo; axis. (See
<a href="#Figure-2_002e20">Figure 2.20</a>.)  From this point of view, the complex number 
\( {z = x + iy} \) (where \( {i^{\kern0.1em 2} = \text{−1}} \)) can be thought of as the point in the plane
whose real coordinate is \( x \) and whose imaginary coordinate is \( y \).
Addition of complex numbers reduces in this representation to addition of
coordinates:
\[ % :46:
\begin{eqnarray}
\text{Real-part} (z_1 + z_2) 	    &amp;=&amp; \text{Real-part} (z_1) + \\
                                    &amp; &amp; \text{Real-part} (z_2),  \\
\text{Imaginary-part} (z_1 + z_2)   &amp;=&amp; \text{Imaginary-part} (z_1) + \\
                                    &amp; &amp; \text{Imaginary-part} (z_2).
\end{eqnarray}
\]
</p>
<div class="float">
<span id="Figure-2_002e20"></span><img src="fig/chap2/Fig2.20.std.svg" alt="fig/chap2/Fig2.20">

<div class="float-caption"><p><strong>Figure 2.20:</strong> Complex numbers as points in the plane.</p></div></div>
<p>When multiplying complex numbers, it is more natural to think in terms of
representing a complex number in polar form, as a magnitude and an angle (\( r \)
and \( A \) in <a href="#Figure-2_002e20">Figure 2.20</a>).  The product of two complex numbers is the
vector obtained by stretching one complex number by the length of the other and
then rotating it through the angle of the other:
\[ % :47:
\begin{eqnarray}
  \text{Magnitude} (z_1 \cdot z_2)  &amp;=&amp; 
    \text{Magnitude} (z_1) \cdot \text{Magnitude} (z_2), \\
  \text{Angle} (z_1 \cdot z_2)      &amp;=&amp; 
    \text{Angle} (z_1) + \text{Angle} (z_2).
\end{eqnarray}
\]
</p>
<p>Thus, there are two different representations for complex numbers, which are
appropriate for different operations.  Yet, from the viewpoint of someone
writing a program that uses complex numbers, the principle of data abstraction
suggests that all the operations for manipulating complex numbers should be
available regardless of which representation is used by the computer.  For
example, it is often useful to be able to find the magnitude of a complex
number that is specified by rectangular coordinates.  Similarly, it is often
useful to be able to determine the real part of a complex number that is
specified by polar coordinates.
</p>
<p>To design such a system, we can follow the same data-abstraction strategy we
followed in designing the rational-number package in <a href="2_002e1.html#g_t2_002e1_002e1">2.1.1</a>.
Assume that the operations on complex numbers are implemented in terms of four
selectors: <code>real-part</code>, <code>imag-part</code>, <code>magnitude</code>, and
<code>angle</code>.  Also assume that we have two procedures for constructing complex
numbers: <code>make-from-real-imag</code> returns a complex number with specified
real and imaginary parts, and <code>make-from-mag-ang</code> returns a complex number
with specified magnitude and angle.  These procedures have the property that,
for any complex number <code>z</code>, both
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(make-from-real-imag (real-part z) 
                     (imag-part z))
</pre></div>

<p>and
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(make-from-mag-ang (magnitude z) 
                   (angle z))
</pre></div>

<p>produce complex numbers that are equal to <code>z</code>.
</p>
<p>Using these constructors and selectors, we can implement arithmetic on complex
numbers using the &ldquo;abstract data&rdquo; specified by the constructors and
selectors, just as we did for rational numbers in <a href="2_002e1.html#g_t2_002e1_002e1">2.1.1</a>.  As
shown in the formulas above, we can add and subtract complex numbers in terms
of real and imaginary parts while multiplying and dividing complex numbers in
terms of magnitudes and angles:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (add-complex z1 z2)
  (make-from-real-imag 
   (+ (real-part z1) (real-part z2))
   (+ (imag-part z1) (imag-part z2))))

(define (sub-complex z1 z2)
  (make-from-real-imag 
   (- (real-part z1) (real-part z2))
   (- (imag-part z1) (imag-part z2))))

(define (mul-complex z1 z2)
  (make-from-mag-ang 
   (* (magnitude z1) (magnitude z2))
   (+ (angle z1) (angle z2))))

(define (div-complex z1 z2)
  (make-from-mag-ang 
   (/ (magnitude z1) (magnitude z2))
   (- (angle z1) (angle z2))))
</pre></div>

<p>To complete the complex-number package, we must choose a representation and we
must implement the constructors and selectors in terms of primitive numbers and
primitive list structure.  There are two obvious ways to do this: We can
represent a complex number in &ldquo;rectangular form&rdquo; as a pair (real part,
imaginary part) or in &ldquo;polar form&rdquo; as a pair (magnitude, angle).  Which shall
we choose?
</p>
<p>In order to make the different choices concrete, imagine that there are two
programmers, Ben Bitdiddle and Alyssa P. Hacker, who are independently
designing representations for the complex-number system.  Ben chooses to
represent complex numbers in rectangular form.  With this choice, selecting the
real and imaginary parts of a complex number is straightforward, as is
constructing a complex number with given real and imaginary parts.  To find the
magnitude and the angle, or to construct a complex number with a given
magnitude and angle, he uses the trigonometric relations
</p>
\[ % :48:
\begin{eqnarray}
  x &amp;=&amp; r \cos A, \\
  y &amp;=&amp; r \sin A, \\
  r &amp;=&amp; \sqrt{x^2 + y^2,} \\
  A &amp;=&amp; \arctan(y, x),
\end{eqnarray}
\]

<p>which relate the real and imaginary parts \( {(x, y)} \) to the magnitude and
the angle \( {(r, A)} \).<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF110" href="#FOOT110"><sup>110</sup></a>  Ben&rsquo;s
representation is therefore given by the following selectors and constructors:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (real-part z) (car z))
(define (imag-part z) (cdr z))

(define (magnitude z)
  (sqrt (+ (square (real-part z)) 
           (square (imag-part z)))))

(define (angle z)
  (atan (imag-part z) (real-part z)))

(define (make-from-real-imag x y) 
  (cons x y))

(define (make-from-mag-ang r a)
  (cons (* r (cos a)) (* r (sin a))))
</pre></div>

<p>Alyssa, in contrast, chooses to represent complex numbers in polar form.  For
her, selecting the magnitude and angle is straightforward, but she has to use
the trigonometric relations to obtain the real and imaginary parts.  Alyssa&rsquo;s
representation is:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (real-part z)
  (* (magnitude z) (cos (angle z))))

(define (imag-part z)
  (* (magnitude z) (sin (angle z))))

(define (magnitude z) (car z))
(define (angle z) (cdr z))

(define (make-from-real-imag x y)
  (cons (sqrt (+ (square x) (square y)))
        (atan y x)))

(define (make-from-mag-ang r a) 
  (cons r a))
</pre></div>

<p>The discipline of data abstraction ensures that the same implementation of
<code>add-complex</code>, <code>sub-complex</code>, <code>mul-complex</code>, and
<code>div-complex</code> will work with either Ben&rsquo;s representation or Alyssa&rsquo;s
representation.
</p>

<span id="g_t2_002e4_002e2"></span><span id="Tagged-data"></span><h4 class="subsection"><span class="secnum">2.4.2</span><span class="sectitle">Tagged data</span></h4>

<p>One way to view data abstraction is as an application of the &ldquo;principle of
least commitment.&rdquo;  In implementing the complex-number system in 
<a href="#g_t2_002e4_002e1">2.4.1</a>, we can use either Ben&rsquo;s rectangular representation or Alyssa&rsquo;s
polar representation.  The abstraction barrier formed by the selectors and
constructors permits us to defer to the last possible moment the choice of a
concrete representation for our data objects and thus retain maximum
flexibility in our system design.
</p>
<p>The principle of least commitment can be carried to even further extremes.  If
we desire, we can maintain the ambiguity of representation even <em>after</em> we
have designed the selectors and constructors, and elect to use both Ben&rsquo;s
representation <em>and</em> Alyssa&rsquo;s representation.  If both representations are
included in a single system, however, we will need some way to distinguish data
in polar form from data in rectangular form.  Otherwise, if we were asked, for
instance, to find the <code>magnitude</code> of the pair (3, 4), we wouldn&rsquo;t know
whether to answer 5 (interpreting the number in rectangular form) or 3
(interpreting the number in polar form).  A straightforward way to accomplish
this distinction is to include a <span id="index-type-tag"></span>
<em>type tag</em>&mdash;the symbol
<code>rectangular</code> or <code>polar</code>&mdash;as part of each complex number.  Then
when we need to manipulate a complex number we can use the tag to decide which
selector to apply.
</p>
<p>In order to manipulate tagged data, we will assume that we have procedures
<code>type-tag</code> and <code>contents</code> that extract from a data object the tag and
the actual contents (the polar or rectangular coordinates, in the case of a
complex number).  We will also postulate a procedure <code>attach-tag</code> that
takes a tag and contents and produces a tagged data object.  A straightforward
way to implement this is to use ordinary list structure:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (attach-tag type-tag contents)
  (cons type-tag contents))

(define (type-tag datum)
  (if (pair? datum)
      (car datum)
      (error &quot;Bad tagged datum: 
              TYPE-TAG&quot; datum)))

(define (contents datum)
  (if (pair? datum)
      (cdr datum)
      (error &quot;Bad tagged datum: 
              CONTENTS&quot; datum)))
</pre></div>

<p>Using these procedures, we can define predicates <code>rectangular?</code>  and
<code>polar?</code>, which recognize rectangular and polar numbers, respectively:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (rectangular? z)
  (eq? (type-tag z) 'rectangular))

(define (polar? z)
  (eq? (type-tag z) 'polar))
</pre></div>

<p>With type tags, Ben and Alyssa can now modify their code so that their two
different representations can coexist in the same system.  Whenever Ben
constructs a complex number, he tags it as rectangular.  Whenever Alyssa
constructs a complex number, she tags it as polar.  In addition, Ben and Alyssa
must make sure that the names of their procedures do not conflict.  One way to
do this is for Ben to append the suffix <code>rectangular</code> to the name of each
of his representation procedures and for Alyssa to append <code>polar</code> to the
names of hers.  Here is Ben&rsquo;s revised rectangular representation from 
<a href="#g_t2_002e4_002e1">2.4.1</a>:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (real-part-rectangular z) (car z))
(define (imag-part-rectangular z) (cdr z))

(define (magnitude-rectangular z)
  (sqrt (+ (square (real-part-rectangular z))
           (square (imag-part-rectangular z)))))

(define (angle-rectangular z)
  (atan (imag-part-rectangular z)
        (real-part-rectangular z)))

(define (make-from-real-imag-rectangular x y)
  (attach-tag 'rectangular (cons x y)))

(define (make-from-mag-ang-rectangular r a)
  (attach-tag 
   'rectangular
   (cons (* r (cos a)) (* r (sin a)))))
</pre></div>

<p>and here is Alyssa&rsquo;s revised polar representation:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (real-part-polar z)
  (* (magnitude-polar z) 
     (cos (angle-polar z))))

(define (imag-part-polar z)
  (* (magnitude-polar z) 
     (sin (angle-polar z))))

(define (magnitude-polar z) (car z))
(define (angle-polar z) (cdr z))

(define (make-from-real-imag-polar x y)
  (attach-tag 
   'polar
   (cons (sqrt (+ (square x) (square y)))
         (atan y x))))

(define (make-from-mag-ang-polar r a)
  (attach-tag 'polar (cons r a)))
</pre></div>

<p>Each generic selector is implemented as a procedure that checks the tag of its
argument and calls the appropriate procedure for handling data of that type.
For example, to obtain the real part of a complex number, <code>real-part</code>
examines the tag to determine whether to use Ben&rsquo;s <code>real-part-rectangular</code>
or Alyssa&rsquo;s <code>real-part-polar</code>.  In either case, we use <code>contents</code> to
extract the bare, untagged datum and send this to the rectangular or polar
procedure as required:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (real-part z)
  (cond ((rectangular? z)
         (real-part-rectangular (contents z)))
        ((polar? z)
         (real-part-polar (contents z)))
        (else (error &quot;Unknown type: 
               REAL-PART&quot; z))))

(define (imag-part z)
  (cond ((rectangular? z)
         (imag-part-rectangular (contents z)))
        ((polar? z)
         (imag-part-polar (contents z)))
        (else (error &quot;Unknown type: 
               IMAG-PART&quot; z))))

(define (magnitude z)
  (cond ((rectangular? z)
         (magnitude-rectangular (contents z)))
        ((polar? z)
         (magnitude-polar (contents z)))
        (else (error &quot;Unknown type: 
               MAGNITUDE&quot; z))))

(define (angle z)
  (cond ((rectangular? z)
         (angle-rectangular (contents z)))
        ((polar? z)
         (angle-polar (contents z)))
        (else (error &quot;Unknown type: 
               ANGLE&quot; z))))
</pre></div>

<p>To implement the complex-number arithmetic operations, we can use the same
procedures <code>add-complex</code>, <code>sub-complex</code>, <code>mul-complex</code>, and
<code>div-complex</code> from <a href="#g_t2_002e4_002e1">2.4.1</a>, because the selectors they call
are generic, and so will work with either representation.  For example, the
procedure <code>add-complex</code> is still
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (add-complex z1 z2)
  (make-from-real-imag 
   (+ (real-part z1) (real-part z2))
   (+ (imag-part z1) (imag-part z2))))
</pre></div>

<p>Finally, we must choose whether to construct complex numbers using Ben&rsquo;s
representation or Alyssa&rsquo;s representation.  One reasonable choice is to
construct rectangular numbers whenever we have real and imaginary parts and to
construct polar numbers whenever we have magnitudes and angles:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (make-from-real-imag x y)
  (make-from-real-imag-rectangular x y))

(define (make-from-mag-ang r a)
  (make-from-mag-ang-polar r a))
</pre></div>

<p>The resulting complex-number system has the structure shown in <a href="#Figure-2_002e21">Figure 2.21</a>.  
The system has been decomposed into three relatively independent parts:
the complex-number-arithmetic operations, Alyssa&rsquo;s polar implementation, and
Ben&rsquo;s rectangular implementation.  The polar and rectangular implementations
could have been written by Ben and Alyssa working separately, and both of these
can be used as underlying representations by a third programmer implementing
the complex-arithmetic procedures in terms of the abstract constructor/selector
interface.

<p>Since each data object is tagged with its type, the selectors operate on the
data in a generic manner.  That is, each selector is defined to have a behavior
that depends upon the particular type of data it is applied to.  Notice the
general mechanism for interfacing the separate representations: Within a given
representation implementation (say, Alyssa&rsquo;s polar package) a complex number is
an untyped pair (magnitude, angle).  When a generic selector operates on a
number of <code>polar</code> type, it strips off the tag and passes the contents on
to Alyssa&rsquo;s code.  Conversely, when Alyssa constructs a number for general use,
she tags it with a type so that it can be appropriately recognized by the
higher-level procedures.  This discipline of stripping off and attaching tags
as data objects are passed from level to level can be an important
organizational strategy, as we shall see in <a href="2_002e5.html#g_t2_002e5">2.5</a>.

<p>The general strategy of checking the type of a datum and calling an appropriate
procedure is called <span id="index-dispatching-on-type"></span>
<em>dispatching on type</em>.  This is a powerful strategy
for obtaining modularity in system design.  On the other hand, implementing the
dispatch as in <a href="#g_t2_002e4_002e2">2.4.2</a> has two significant weaknesses.  One
weakness is that the generic interface procedures (<code>real-part</code>,
<code>imag-part</code>, <code>magnitude</code>, and <code>angle</code>) must know about all the
different representations.  For instance, suppose we wanted to incorporate a
new representation for complex numbers into our complex-number system.  We
would need to identify this new representation with a type, and then add a
clause to each of the generic interface procedures to check for the new type
and apply the appropriate selector for that representation.
</p>
<p>Another weakness of the technique is that even though the individual
representations can be designed separately, we must guarantee that no two
procedures in the entire system have the same name.  This is why Ben and Alyssa
had to change the names of their original procedures from <a href="#g_t2_002e4_002e1">2.4.1</a>.
</p>
<p>The issue underlying both of these weaknesses is that the technique for
implementing generic interfaces is not <span id="index-additive"></span>
<em>additive</em>.  The person
implementing the generic selector procedures must modify those procedures each
time a new representation is installed, and the people interfacing the
individual representations must modify their code to avoid name conflicts.  In
each of these cases, the changes that must be made to the code are
straightforward, but they must be made nonetheless, and this is a source of
inconvenience and error.  This is not much of a problem for the complex-number
system as it stands, but suppose there were not two but hundreds of different
representations for complex numbers.  And suppose that there were many generic
selectors to be maintained in the abstract-data interface.  Suppose, in fact,
that no one programmer knew all the interface procedures or all the
representations.  The problem is real and must be addressed in such programs as
large-scale data-base-management systems.
</p>
<p>What we need is a means for modularizing the system design even further.  This
is provided by the programming technique known as <span id="index-data_002ddirected-programming-1"></span>
<em>data-directed programming</em>.  
To understand how data-directed programming works, begin with
the observation that whenever we deal with a set of generic operations that are
common to a set of different types we are, in effect, dealing with a
two-dimensional table that contains the possible operations on one axis and the
possible types on the other axis.  The entries in the table are the procedures
that implement each operation for each type of argument presented.  In the
complex-number system developed in the previous section, the correspondence
between operation name, data type, and actual procedure was spread out among
the various conditional clauses in the generic interface procedures.  But the
same information could have been organized in a table, as shown in <a href="#Figure-2_002e22">Figure 2.22</a>.
</p>
<div class="float">
<span id="Figure-2_002e22"></span><img src="fig/chap2/Fig2.22.std.svg" alt="fig/chap2/Fig2.22">

<div class="float-caption"><p><strong>Figure 2.22:</strong> Table of operations for the complex-number system.</p></div></div>
<p>Data-directed programming is the technique of designing programs to work with
such a table directly.  Previously, we implemented the mechanism that
interfaces the complex-arithmetic code with the two representation packages as
a set of procedures that each perform an explicit dispatch on type.  Here we
will implement the interface as a single procedure that looks up the
combination of the operation name and argument type in the table to find the
correct procedure to apply, and then applies it to the contents of the
argument.  If we do this, then to add a new representation package to the
system we need not change any existing procedures; we need only add new entries
to the table.
</p>
<p>To implement this plan, assume that we have two procedures, <code>put</code> and
<code>get</code>, for manipulating the operation-and-type table:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <code>(put ⟨<var>op</var>⟩ ⟨<var>type</var>⟩ ⟨<var>item</var>⟩)</code> installs the 
<code>⟨</code><var>item</var><code>⟩</code> in the table, indexed by the 
<code>⟨</code><var>op</var><code>⟩</code> and the <code>⟨</code><var>type</var><code>⟩</code>.

</li><li> <code>(get ⟨<var>op</var>⟩ ⟨<var>type</var>⟩)</code> looks up the <code>⟨</code><var>op</var><code>⟩</code>, 
<code>⟨</code><var>type</var><code>⟩</code> entry in the table and returns the item found there.  
If no item is found, <code>get</code> returns false.

</li></ul>

<p>For now, we can assume that <code>put</code> and <code>get</code> are included in our
language.  In <a href="Chapter-3.html">Chapter 3</a> (<a href="3_002e3.html#g_t3_002e3_002e3">3.3.3</a>) we
will see how to implement these and other operations for manipulating tables.
</p>
<p>Here is how data-directed programming can be used in the complex-number system.
Ben, who developed the rectangular representation, implements his code just as
he did originally.  He defines a collection of procedures, or a
<span id="index-package"></span>
<em>package</em>, and interfaces these to the rest of the system by adding
entries to the table that tell the system how to operate on rectangular
numbers.  This is accomplished by calling the following procedure:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (install-rectangular-package)
  <span class="roman">;; internal procedures</span>
  (define (real-part z) (car z))
  (define (imag-part z) (cdr z))
  (define (make-from-real-imag x y) 
    (cons x y))
  (define (magnitude z)
    (sqrt (+ (square (real-part z))
             (square (imag-part z)))))
  (define (angle z)
    (atan (imag-part z) (real-part z)))
  (define (make-from-mag-ang r a)
    (cons (* r (cos a)) (* r (sin a))))
  <span class="roman">;; interface to the rest of the system</span>
  (define (tag x) 
    (attach-tag 'rectangular x))
  (put 'real-part '(rectangular) real-part)
  (put 'imag-part '(rectangular) imag-part)
  (put 'magnitude '(rectangular) magnitude)
  (put 'angle '(rectangular) angle)
  (put 'make-from-real-imag 'rectangular
       (lambda (x y) 
         (tag (make-from-real-imag x y))))
  (put 'make-from-mag-ang 'rectangular
       (lambda (r a) 
         (tag (make-from-mag-ang r a))))
  'done)
</pre></div>

<p>Notice that the internal procedures here are the same procedures from 
<a href="#g_t2_002e4_002e1">2.4.1</a> that Ben wrote when he was working in isolation.  No changes are
necessary in order to interface them to the rest of the system.  Moreover,
since these procedure definitions are internal to the installation procedure,
Ben needn&rsquo;t worry about name conflicts with other procedures outside the
rectangular package.  To interface these to the rest of the system, Ben
installs his <code>real-part</code> procedure under the operation name
<code>real-part</code> and the type <code>(rectangular)</code>, and similarly for the other
selectors.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF111" href="#FOOT111"><sup>111</sup></a>  The interface also defines the
constructors to be used by the external system.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF112" href="#FOOT112"><sup>112</sup></a>  These are identical to
Ben&rsquo;s internally defined constructors, except that they attach the tag.
</p>
<p>Alyssa&rsquo;s polar package is analogous:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (install-polar-package)
  <span class="roman">;; internal procedures</span>
  (define (magnitude z) (car z))
  (define (angle z) (cdr z))
  (define (make-from-mag-ang r a) (cons r a))
  (define (real-part z)
    (* (magnitude z) (cos (angle z))))
  (define (imag-part z)
    (* (magnitude z) (sin (angle z))))
  (define (make-from-real-imag x y)
    (cons (sqrt (+ (square x) (square y)))
          (atan y x)))
  <span class="roman">;; interface to the rest of the system</span>
  (define (tag x) (attach-tag 'polar x))
  (put 'real-part '(polar) real-part)
  (put 'imag-part '(polar) imag-part)
  (put 'magnitude '(polar) magnitude)
  (put 'angle '(polar) angle)
  (put 'make-from-real-imag 'polar
       (lambda (x y) 
         (tag (make-from-real-imag x y))))
  (put 'make-from-mag-ang 'polar
       (lambda (r a) 
         (tag (make-from-mag-ang r a))))
  'done)
</pre></div>

<p>Even though Ben and Alyssa both still use their original procedures defined
with the same names as each other&rsquo;s (e.g., <code>real-part</code>), these definitions
are now internal to different procedures (see <a href="1_002e1.html#g_t1_002e1_002e8">1.1.8</a>), so there is
no name conflict.
</p>
<p>The complex-arithmetic selectors access the table by means of a general
&ldquo;operation&rdquo; procedure called <code>apply-generic</code>, which applies a generic
operation to some arguments.  <code>Apply-generic</code> looks in the table under the
name of the operation and the types of the arguments and applies the resulting
procedure if one is present:<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF113" href="#FOOT113"><sup>113</sup></a>
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (apply-generic op . args)
  (let ((type-tags (map type-tag args)))
    (let ((proc (get op type-tags)))
      (if proc
          (apply proc (map contents args))
          (error
            &quot;No method for these types: 
             APPLY-GENERIC&quot;
            (list op type-tags))))))
</pre></div>

<p>Using <code>apply-generic</code>, we can define our generic selectors as follows:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (real-part z) 
  (apply-generic 'real-part z))
(define (imag-part z) 
  (apply-generic 'imag-part z))
(define (magnitude z) 
  (apply-generic 'magnitude z))
(define (angle z) 
  (apply-generic 'angle z))
</pre></div>

<p>Observe that these do not change at all if a new representation is added to the
system.
</p>
<p>We can also extract from the table the constructors to be used by the programs
external to the packages in making complex numbers from real and imaginary
parts and from magnitudes and angles.  As in <a href="#g_t2_002e4_002e2">2.4.2</a>, we construct
rectangular numbers whenever we have real and imaginary parts, and polar
numbers whenever we have magnitudes and angles:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (make-from-real-imag x y)
  ((get 'make-from-real-imag 
        'rectangular) 
   x y))

(define (make-from-mag-ang r a)
  ((get 'make-from-mag-ang 
        'polar) 
   r a))

data-directed style by rewriting the basic derivative procedure as

<p><strong><span id="Exercise-2_002e74"></span>Exercise 2.74:</strong> Insatiable Enterprises, Inc., is
a highly decentralized conglomerate company consisting of a large number of
independent divisions located all over the world.  The company&rsquo;s computer
facilities have just been interconnected by means of a clever
network-interfacing scheme that makes the entire network appear to any user to
be a single computer.  Insatiable&rsquo;s president, in her first attempt to exploit
the ability of the network to extract administrative information from division
files, is dismayed to discover that, although all the division files have been
implemented as data structures in Scheme, the particular data structure used
varies from division to division.  A meeting of division managers is hastily
called to search for a strategy to integrate the files that will satisfy
headquarters&rsquo; needs while preserving the existing autonomy of the divisions.

an example, suppose that each division&rsquo;s personnel records consist of a single
file, which contains a set of records keyed on employees&rsquo; names.  The structure
of the set varies from division to division.  Furthermore, each employee&rsquo;s
record is itself a set (structured differently from division to division) that
contains information keyed under identifiers such as <code>address</code> and

<span id="Message-passing"></span><h4 class="subsubheading">Message passing</h4>

<p>The key idea of data-directed programming is to handle generic operations in
programs by dealing explicitly with operation-and-type tables, such as the
table in <a href="#Figure-2_002e22">Figure 2.22</a>.  The style of programming we used in 
<a href="#g_t2_002e4_002e2">2.4.2</a> organized the required dispatching on type by having each operation
take care of its own dispatching.  In effect, this decomposes the
operation-and-type table into rows, with each generic operation procedure
representing a row of the table.
</p>
<p>An alternative implementation strategy is to decompose the table into columns
and, instead of using &ldquo;intelligent operations&rdquo; that dispatch on data types,
to work with &ldquo;intelligent data objects&rdquo; that dispatch on operation names.  We
can do this by arranging things so that a data object, such as a rectangular
number, is represented as a procedure that takes as input the required
operation name and performs the operation indicated.  In such a discipline,
<code>make-from-real-imag</code> could be written as
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (make-from-real-imag x y)
  (define (dispatch op)
    (cond ((eq? op 'real-part) x)
          ((eq? op 'imag-part) y)
          ((eq? op 'magnitude)
           (sqrt (+ (square x) (square y))))
          ((eq? op 'angle) (atan y x))
          (else
           (error &quot;Unknown op: 
            MAKE-FROM-REAL-IMAG&quot; op))))
  dispatch)
</pre></div>

<p>The corresponding <code>apply-generic</code> procedure, which applies a generic
operation to an argument, now simply feeds the operation&rsquo;s name to the data
object and lets the object do the work:<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF114" href="#FOOT114"><sup>114</sup></a>
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (apply-generic op arg) (arg op))
</pre></div>

<p>Note that the value returned by <code>make-from-real-imag</code> is a procedure&mdash;the
internal <code>dispatch</code> procedure.  This is the procedure that is invoked when
<code>apply-generic</code> requests an operation to be performed.
</p>
<p>This style of programming is called <span id="index-message-passing-1"></span>
<em>message passing</em>.  The name comes
from the image that a data object is an entity that receives the requested
operation name as a &ldquo;message.&rdquo;  We have already seen an example of message
passing in <a href="2_002e1.html#g_t2_002e1_002e3">2.1.3</a>, where we saw how <code>cons</code>, <code>car</code>, and
<code>cdr</code> could be defined with no data objects but only procedures.  Here we
see that message passing is not a mathematical trick but a useful technique for
organizing systems with generic operations.  In the remainder of this chapter
we will continue to use data-directed programming, rather than message passing,
to discuss generic arithmetic operations.  In <a href="Chapter-3.html">Chapter 3</a> we will return to
message passing, and we will see that it can be a powerful tool for structuring
simulation programs.
