<p>In this section, we extend the Scheme evaluator to support a programming
paradigm called <span id="index-nondeterministic-computing-1"></span>
<em>nondeterministic computing</em> by building into the
evaluator a facility to support automatic search.  This is a much more profound
change to the language than the introduction of lazy evaluation in 
<a href="4_002e2.html#g_t4_002e2">4.2</a>.
</p>
<p>Nondeterministic computing, like stream processing, is useful for &ldquo;generate
and test&rdquo; applications.  Consider the task of starting with two lists of
positive integers and finding a pair of integers&mdash;one from the first list and
one from the second list&mdash;whose sum is prime.  We saw how to handle this with
finite sequence operations in <a href="2_002e2.html#g_t2_002e2_002e3">2.2.3</a> and with infinite streams in
<a href="3_002e5.html#g_t3_002e5_002e3">3.5.3</a>.  Our approach was to generate the sequence of all possible
pairs and filter these to select the pairs whose sum is prime.  Whether we
actually generate the entire sequence of pairs first as in <a href="Chapter-2.html">Chapter 2</a>, or
interleave the generating and filtering as in <a href="Chapter-3.html">Chapter 3</a>, is immaterial to
the essential image of how the computation is organized.
</p>
<p>The nondeterministic approach evokes a different image.  Imagine simply that we
choose (in some way) a number from the first list and a number from the second
list and require (using some mechanism) that their sum be prime.  This is
expressed by following procedure:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (prime-sum-pair list1 list2)
  (let ((a (an-element-of list1))
        (b (an-element-of list2)))
    (require (prime? (+ a b)))
    (list a b)))
</pre></div>

<p>It might seem as if this procedure merely restates the problem, rather than
specifying a way to solve it.  Nevertheless, this is a legitimate
nondeterministic program.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF246" href="#FOOT246"><sup>246</sup></a>
</p>
<p>The key idea here is that expressions in a nondeterministic language can have
more than one possible value.  For instance, <code>an-element-of</code> might return
any element of the given list.  Our nondeterministic program evaluator will
work by automatically choosing a possible value and keeping track of the
choice.  If a subsequent requirement is not met, the evaluator will try a
different choice, and it will keep trying new choices until the evaluation
succeeds, or until we run out of choices.  Just as the lazy evaluator freed the
programmer from the details of how values are delayed and forced, the
nondeterministic program evaluator will free the programmer from the details of
how choices are made.
</p>
<p>It is instructive to contrast the different images of time evoked by
nondeterministic evaluation and stream processing.  Stream processing uses lazy
evaluation to decouple the time when the stream of possible answers is
assembled from the time when the actual stream elements are produced.  The
evaluator supports the illusion that all the possible answers are laid out
before us in a timeless sequence.  With nondeterministic evaluation, an
expression represents the exploration of a set of possible worlds, each
determined by a set of choices.  Some of the possible worlds lead to dead ends,
while others have useful values.  The nondeterministic program evaluator
supports the illusion that time branches, and that our programs have different
possible execution histories.  When we reach a dead end, we can revisit a
previous choice point and proceed along a different branch.
</p>
<p>The nondeterministic program evaluator implemented below is called the
<code>amb</code> evaluator because it is based on a new special form called
<code>amb</code>.  We can type the above definition of <code>prime-sum-pair</code> at the
<code>amb</code> evaluator driver loop (along with definitions of <code>prime?</code>,
<code>an-element-of</code>, and <code>require</code>) and run the procedure as follows:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp"><i>;;; Amb-Eval input:</i>
(prime-sum-pair '(1 3 5 8) '(20 35 110))

<i>;;; Starting a new problem</i>
<i>;;; Amb-Eval value:</i>
<i>(3 20)</i>
</pre></div>

<p>The value returned was obtained after the evaluator repeatedly chose elements
from each of the lists, until a successful choice was made.
</p>
<p>Section <a href="#g_t4_002e3_002e1">4.3.1</a> introduces <code>amb</code> and explains how it supports
nondeterminism through the evaluator&rsquo;s automatic search mechanism.  
<a href="#g_t4_002e3_002e2">4.3.2</a> presents examples of nondeterministic programs, and 
<a href="#g_t4_002e3_002e3">4.3.3</a> gives the details of how to implement the <code>amb</code> evaluator by
modifying the ordinary Scheme evaluator.

<span id="g_t4_002e3_002e1"></span><span id="Amb-and-Search"></span><h4 class="subsection"><span class="secnum">4.3.1</span><span class="sectitle">Amb and Search</span></h4>

<p>To extend Scheme to support nondeterminism, we introduce a new special form
called <code>amb</code>.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF247" href="#FOOT247"><sup>247</sup></a>
The expression
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(amb ⟨<var>e₁</var>⟩ ⟨<var>e₂</var>⟩ <span class="roman">…</span> ⟨<var>eₙ</var>⟩)
</pre></div>

<p>returns the value of one of the \( n \) expressions \( {⟨\kern0.03em e_i⟩} \)
&ldquo;ambiguously.&rdquo;  For example, the expression
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(list (amb 1 2 3) (amb 'a 'b))
</pre></div>

<p>can have six possible values:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example"><code>(1 a)</code> <code>(1 b)</code> <code>(2 a)</code> <code>(2 b)</code> <code>(3 a)</code> <code>(3 b)</code>
</pre></div>

<p><code>Amb</code> with a single choice produces an ordinary (single) value.
</p>
<p><code>Amb</code> with no choices&mdash;the expression <code>(amb)</code>&mdash;is an expression
with no acceptable values.  Operationally, we can think of <code>(amb)</code> as an
expression that when evaluated causes the computation to &ldquo;fail&rdquo;: The
computation aborts and no value is produced.  Using this idea, we can express
the requirement that a particular predicate expression <code>p</code> must be true as
follows:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (require p)
  (if (not p) (amb)))
</pre></div>

<p>With <code>amb</code> and <code>require</code>, we can implement the <code>an-element-of</code>
procedure used above:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (an-element-of items)
  (require (not (null? items)))
  (amb (car items) 
       (an-element-of (cdr items))))
</pre></div>

<p><code>An-element-of</code> fails if the list is empty.  Otherwise it ambiguously
returns either the first element of the list or an element chosen from the rest
of the list.
</p>
<p>We can also express infinite ranges of choices.  The following procedure
potentially returns any integer greater than or equal to some given \( n \):
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (an-integer-starting-from n)
  (amb n (an-integer-starting-from (+ n 1))))
</pre></div>

<p>This is like the stream procedure <code>integers-starting-from</code> described in
<a href="3_002e5.html#g_t3_002e5_002e2">3.5.2</a>, but with an important difference: The stream procedure
returns an object that represents the sequence of all integers beginning with
\( n \), whereas the <code>amb</code> procedure returns a single integer.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF248" href="#FOOT248"><sup>248</sup></a>
</p>
<p>Abstractly, we can imagine that evaluating an <code>amb</code> expression causes time
to split into branches, where the computation continues on each branch with one
of the possible values of the expression.  We say that <code>amb</code> represents a
<span id="index-nondeterministic-choice-point"></span>
<em>nondeterministic choice point</em>.  If we had a machine with a sufficient
number of processors that could be dynamically allocated, we could implement
the search in a straightforward way.  Execution would proceed as in a
sequential machine, until an <code>amb</code> expression is encountered.  At this
point, more processors would be allocated and initialized to continue all of
the parallel executions implied by the choice.  Each processor would proceed
sequentially as if it were the only choice, until it either terminates by
encountering a failure, or it further subdivides, or it finishes.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF249" href="#FOOT249"><sup>249</sup></a>
</p>
<p>On the other hand, if we have a machine that can execute only one process (or a
few concurrent processes), we must consider the alternatives sequentially.  One
could imagine modifying an evaluator to pick at random a branch to follow
whenever it encounters a choice point.  Random choice, however, can easily lead
to failing values.  We might try running the evaluator over and over, making
random choices and hoping to find a non-failing value, but it is better to
<span id="index-systematically-search"></span>
<em>systematically search</em> all possible execution paths.  The <code>amb</code>
evaluator that we will develop and work with in this section implements a
systematic search as follows: When the evaluator encounters an application of
<code>amb</code>, it initially selects the first alternative.  This selection may
itself lead to a further choice.  The evaluator will always initially choose
the first alternative at each choice point.  If a choice results in a failure,
then the evaluator automagically<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF250" href="#FOOT250"><sup>250</sup></a> 
<span id="index-backtracks"></span>
<em>backtracks</em> to the most
recent choice point and tries the next alternative.  If it runs out of
alternatives at any choice point, the evaluator will back up to the previous
choice point and resume from there.  This process leads to a search strategy
known as <span id="index-depth_002dfirst-search"></span>
<em>depth-first search</em> or <span id="index-chronological-backtracking"></span>
<em>chronological backtracking</em>.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF251" href="#FOOT251"><sup>251</sup></a>
</p>
<span id="Driver-loop"></span><h4 class="subsubheading">Driver loop</h4>

<p>The driver loop for the <code>amb</code> evaluator has some unusual properties.  It
reads an expression and prints the value of the first non-failing execution, as
in the <code>prime-sum-pair</code> example shown above.  If we want to see the value
of the next successful execution, we can ask the interpreter to backtrack and
attempt to generate a second non-failing execution.  This is signaled by typing
the symbol <code>try-again</code>.  If any expression except <code>try-again</code> is
given, the interpreter will start a new problem, discarding the unexplored
alternatives in the previous problem.  Here is a sample interaction:

<span id="Logic-Puzzles"></span><h4 class="subsubheading">Logic Puzzles</h4>

<p>The following puzzle (taken from <a href="References.html#Dinesman-1968">Dinesman 1968</a>) is typical of a large class of
simple logic puzzles:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Baker, Cooper, Fletcher, Miller, and Smith live on different floors of an
apartment house that contains only five floors.  Baker does not live on the top
floor.  Cooper does not live on the bottom floor.  Fletcher does not live on
either the top or the bottom floor.  Miller lives on a higher floor than does
Cooper.  Smith does not live on a floor adjacent to Fletcher&rsquo;s.  Fletcher does
not live on a floor adjacent to Cooper&rsquo;s.  Where does everyone live?
</p></blockquote>

<p>We can determine who lives on each floor in a straightforward way by
enumerating all the possibilities and imposing the given
restrictions:<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF252" href="#FOOT252"><sup>252</sup></a>
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (multiple-dwelling)
  (let ((baker (amb 1 2 3 4 5))
        (cooper (amb 1 2 3 4 5))
        (fletcher (amb 1 2 3 4 5))
        (miller (amb 1 2 3 4 5))
        (smith (amb 1 2 3 4 5)))
    (require
     (distinct? (list baker cooper fletcher 
                      miller smith)))
    (require (not (= baker 5)))
    (require (not (= cooper 1)))
    (require (not (= fletcher 5)))
    (require (not (= fletcher 1)))
    (require (&gt; miller cooper))
    (require
     (not (= (abs (- smith fletcher)) 1)))
    (require 
     (not (= (abs (- fletcher cooper)) 1)))
    (list (list 'baker baker)
          (list 'cooper cooper)
          (list 'fletcher fletcher)
          (list 'miller miller)
          (list 'smith smith))))
</pre></div>

<p>Evaluating the expression <code>(multiple-dwelling)</code> produces the result
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">((baker 3) (cooper 2) (fletcher 4)

<p>Although this simple procedure works, it is very slow.  <a href="#Exercise-4_002e39">Exercise 4.39</a> and
<a href="#Exercise-4_002e40">Exercise 4.40</a> discuss some possible improvements.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><span id="Exercise-4_002e40"></span>Exercise 4.40:</strong> In the multiple dwelling problem,
how many sets of assignments are there of people to floors, both before and
after the requirement that floor assignments be distinct?  It is very
inefficient to generate all possible assignments of people to floors and then
leave it to backtracking to eliminate them.  For example, most of the
restrictions depend on only one or two of the person-floor variables, and can
thus be imposed before floors have been selected for all the people.  Write and
demonstrate a much more efficient nondeterministic procedure that solves this
problem based upon generating only those possibilities that are not already
ruled out by previous restrictions.  (Hint: This will require a nest of
<code>let</code> expressions.)

<span id="Parsing-natural-language"></span><h4 class="subsubheading">Parsing natural language</h4>

<p>Programs designed to accept natural language as input usually start by
attempting to <span id="index-parse"></span>
<em>parse</em> the input, that is, to match the input against
some grammatical structure.  For example, we might try to recognize simple
sentences consisting of an article followed by a noun followed by a verb, such
as &ldquo;The cat eats.&rdquo;  To accomplish such an analysis, we must be able to
identify the parts of speech of individual words.  We could start with some
lists that classify various words:<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF254" href="#FOOT254"><sup>254</sup></a>
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define nouns 
  '(noun student professor cat class))

(define verbs 
  '(verb studies lectures eats sleeps))

(define articles '(article the a))
</pre></div>

<p>We also need a <span id="index-grammar"></span>
<em>grammar</em>, that is, a set of rules describing how
grammatical elements are composed from simpler elements.  A very simple grammar
might stipulate that a sentence always consists of two pieces&mdash;a noun phrase
followed by a verb&mdash;and that a noun phrase consists of an article followed by
a noun.  With this grammar, the sentence &ldquo;The cat eats&rdquo; is parsed as follows:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(sentence
 (noun-phrase (article the) (noun cat))
 (verb eats))
</pre></div>

<p>We can generate such a parse with a simple program that has separate procedures
for each of the grammatical rules.  To parse a sentence, we identify its two
constituent pieces and return a list of these two elements, tagged with the
symbol <code>sentence</code>:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (parse-sentence)
  (list 'sentence
         (parse-noun-phrase)
         (parse-word verbs)))
</pre></div>

<p>A noun phrase, similarly, is parsed by finding an article followed by a
noun:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (parse-noun-phrase)
  (list 'noun-phrase
        (parse-word articles)
        (parse-word nouns)))
</pre></div>

<p>At the lowest level, parsing boils down to repeatedly checking that the next
unparsed word is a member of the list of words for the required part of speech.
To implement this, we maintain a global variable <code>*unparsed*</code>, which is
the input that has not yet been parsed.  Each time we check a word, we require
that <code>*unparsed*</code> must be non-empty and that it should begin with a word
from the designated list.  If so, we remove that word from <code>*unparsed*</code>
and return the word together with its part of speech (which is found at the
head of the list):<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF255" href="#FOOT255"><sup>255</sup></a>
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (parse-word word-list)
  (require (not (null? *unparsed*)))
  (require (memq (car *unparsed*) 
                 (cdr word-list)))
  (let ((found-word (car *unparsed*)))
    (set! *unparsed* (cdr *unparsed*))
    (list (car word-list) found-word)))
</pre></div>

<p>To start the parsing, all we need to do is set <code>*unparsed*</code> to be the
entire input, try to parse a sentence, and check that nothing is left over:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define *unparsed* '())
(define (parse input)
  (set! *unparsed* input)
  (let ((sent (parse-sentence)))
    (require (null? *unparsed*))
    sent))
</pre></div>

<p>We can now try the parser and verify that it works for our simple test
sentence:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp"><i>;;; Amb-Eval input:</i>
(parse '(the cat eats))

<i>;;; Starting a new problem</i>
<i>;;; Amb-Eval value:</i>
<i>(sentence 
 (noun-phrase (article the) (noun cat))
 (verb eats))</i>
</pre></div>

<p>The <code>amb</code> evaluator is useful here because it is convenient to express the
parsing constraints with the aid of <code>require</code>.  Automatic search and
backtracking really pay off, however, when we consider more complex grammars
where there are choices for how the units can be decomposed.
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s add to our grammar a list of prepositions:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define prepositions 
  '(prep for to in by with))
</pre></div>

<p>and define a prepositional phrase (e.g., &ldquo;for the cat&rdquo;) to be a preposition
followed by a noun phrase:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (parse-prepositional-phrase)
  (list 'prep-phrase
        (parse-word prepositions)
        (parse-noun-phrase)))
</pre></div>

<p>Now we can define a sentence to be a noun phrase followed by a verb phrase,
where a verb phrase can be either a verb or a verb phrase extended by a
prepositional phrase:<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF256" href="#FOOT256"><sup>256</sup></a>
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (parse-sentence)
  (list 'sentence
         (parse-noun-phrase)
         (parse-verb-phrase)))

(define (parse-verb-phrase)
  (define (maybe-extend verb-phrase)
    (amb 
     verb-phrase
     (maybe-extend 
      (list 'verb-phrase
            verb-phrase
            (parse-prepositional-phrase)))))
  (maybe-extend (parse-word verbs)))
</pre></div>

<p>While we&rsquo;re at it, we can also elaborate the definition of noun phrases to
permit such things as &ldquo;a cat in the class.&rdquo;  What we used to call a noun
phrase, we&rsquo;ll now call a simple noun phrase, and a noun phrase will now be
either a simple noun phrase or a noun phrase extended by a prepositional
phrase:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (parse-simple-noun-phrase)
  (list 'simple-noun-phrase
        (parse-word articles)
        (parse-word nouns)))

(define (parse-noun-phrase)
  (define (maybe-extend noun-phrase)
    (amb 
     noun-phrase
     (maybe-extend 
      (list 'noun-phrase
            noun-phrase
            (parse-prepositional-phrase)))))
  (maybe-extend (parse-simple-noun-phrase)))
</pre></div>

<p>Our new grammar lets us parse more complex sentences.  For example
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(parse '(the student with the cat 
         sleeps in the class))
</pre></div>

<p>produces
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(sentence
 (noun-phrase
  (simple-noun-phrase (article the) 
                      (noun student))
  (prep-phrase (prep with)
               (simple-noun-phrase
                (article the)
                (noun cat))))
 (verb-phrase
  (verb sleeps)
  (prep-phrase (prep in)
               (simple-noun-phrase
                (article the)
                (noun class)))))
</pre></div>

<p>Observe that a given input may have more than one legal parse.  In the sentence
&ldquo;The professor lectures to the student with the cat,&rdquo; it may be that the
professor is lecturing with the cat, or that the student has the cat.  Our
nondeterministic program finds both possibilities:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(parse '(the professor lectures to 
         the student with the cat))
</pre></div>

<p>produces
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(sentence
 (simple-noun-phrase (article the) 
                     (noun professor))
 (verb-phrase
  (verb-phrase
   (verb lectures)
   (prep-phrase (prep to)
                (simple-noun-phrase
                 (article the) 
                 (noun student))))
  (prep-phrase (prep with)
               (simple-noun-phrase
                (article the) 
                (noun cat)))))
</pre></div>

<p>Asking the evaluator to try again yields
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(sentence
 (simple-noun-phrase (article the) 
                     (noun professor))

<p>The evaluation of an ordinary Scheme expression may return a value, may never
terminate, or may signal an error.  In nondeterministic Scheme the evaluation
of an expression may in addition result in the discovery of a dead end, in
which case evaluation must backtrack to a previous choice point.  The
interpretation of nondeterministic Scheme is complicated by this extra case.
</p>
<p>We will construct the <code>amb</code> evaluator for nondeterministic Scheme by
modifying the analyzing evaluator of <a href="4_002e1.html#g_t4_002e1_002e7">4.1.7</a>.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF259" href="#FOOT259"><sup>259</sup></a>  As in the analyzing
evaluator, evaluation of an expression is accomplished by calling an execution
procedure produced by analysis of that expression.  The difference between the
interpretation of ordinary Scheme and the interpretation of nondeterministic
Scheme will be entirely in the execution procedures.
</p>
<span id="Execution-procedures-and-continuations"></span><h4 class="subsubheading">Execution procedures and continuations</h4>

<p>Recall that the execution procedures for the ordinary evaluator take one
argument: the environment of execution.  In contrast, the execution procedures
in the <code>amb</code> evaluator take three arguments: the environment, and two
procedures called <span id="index-continuation-procedures"></span>
<em>continuation procedures</em>.  The evaluation of an
expression will finish by calling one of these two continuations: If the
evaluation results in a value, the <span id="index-success-continuation"></span>
<em>success continuation</em> is called
with that value; if the evaluation results in the discovery of a dead end, the
<span id="index-failure-continuation"></span>
<em>failure continuation</em> is called.  Constructing and calling appropriate
continuations is the mechanism by which the nondeterministic evaluator
implements backtracking.
</p>
<p>It is the job of the success continuation to receive a value and proceed with
the computation.  Along with that value, the success continuation is passed
another failure continuation, which is to be called subsequently if the use of
that value leads to a dead end.
</p>
<p>It is the job of the failure continuation to try another branch of the
nondeterministic process.  The essence of the nondeterministic language is in
the fact that expressions may represent choices among alternatives.  The
evaluation of such an expression must proceed with one of the indicated
alternative choices, even though it is not known in advance which choices will
lead to acceptable results.  To deal with this, the evaluator picks one of the
alternatives and passes this value to the success continuation.  Together with
this value, the evaluator constructs and passes along a failure continuation
that can be called later to choose a different alternative.
</p>
<p>A failure is triggered during evaluation (that is, a failure continuation is
called) when a user program explicitly rejects the current line of attack (for
example, a call to <code>require</code> may result in execution of <code>(amb)</code>, an
expression that always fails&mdash;see <a href="#g_t4_002e3_002e1">4.3.1</a>).  The failure
continuation in hand at that point will cause the most recent choice point to
choose another alternative.  If there are no more alternatives to be considered
at that choice point, a failure at an earlier choice point is triggered, and so
on.  Failure continuations are also invoked by the driver loop in response to a
<code>try-again</code> request, to find another value of the expression.
</p>
<p>In addition, if a side-effect operation (such as assignment to a variable)
occurs on a branch of the process resulting from a choice, it may be necessary,
when the process finds a dead end, to undo the side effect before making a new
choice.  This is accomplished by having the side-effect operation produce a
failure continuation that undoes the side effect and propagates the failure.
</p>
<p>In summary, failure continuations are constructed by
</p>
<ul>
<li> <code>amb</code> expressions&mdash;to provide a mechanism to make alternative choices if
the current choice made by the <code>amb</code> expression leads to a dead end;

</li><li> the top-level driver&mdash;to provide a mechanism to report failure when the
choices are exhausted;

</li><li> assignments&mdash;to intercept failures and undo assignments during backtracking.

</li></ul>

<p>Failures are initiated only when a dead end is encountered.  This occurs
</p>
<ul>
<li> if the user program executes <code>(amb)</code>;

</li><li> if the user types <code>try-again</code> at the top-level driver.

</li></ul>

<p>Failure continuations are also called during processing of a failure:
</p>
<ul>
<li> When the failure continuation created by an assignment finishes undoing a side
effect, it calls the failure continuation it intercepted, in order to propagate
the failure back to the choice point that led to this assignment or to the top
level.

</li><li> When the failure continuation for an <code>amb</code> runs out of choices, it calls
the failure continuation that was originally given to the <code>amb</code>, in order
to propagate the failure back to the previous choice point or to the top level.

</li></ul>

<span id="Structure-of-the-evaluator"></span><h4 class="subsubheading">Structure of the evaluator</h4>

<p>The syntax- and data-representation procedures for the <code>amb</code> evaluator,
and also the basic <code>analyze</code> procedure, are identical to those in the
evaluator of <a href="4_002e1.html#g_t4_002e1_002e7">4.1.7</a>, except for the fact that we need additional
syntax procedures to recognize the <code>amb</code> special form:<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF260" href="#FOOT260"><sup>260</sup></a>
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (amb? exp) (tagged-list? exp 'amb))
(define (amb-choices exp) (cdr exp))
</pre></div>

<p>We must also add to the dispatch in <code>analyze</code> a clause that will recognize
this special form and generate an appropriate execution procedure:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">((amb? exp) (analyze-amb exp))
</pre></div>

<p>The top-level procedure <code>ambeval</code> (similar to the version of <code>eval</code>
given in <a href="4_002e1.html#g_t4_002e1_002e7">4.1.7</a>) analyzes the given expression and applies the
resulting execution procedure to the given environment, together with two given
continuations:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (ambeval exp env succeed fail)
  ((analyze exp) env succeed fail))
</pre></div>

<p>A success continuation is a procedure of two arguments: the value just obtained
and another failure continuation to be used if that value leads to a subsequent
failure. A failure continuation is a procedure of no arguments.  So the general
form of an execution procedure is
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(lambda (env succeed fail)
  <span class="roman">;; <code>succeed</code> is <code>(lambda (value fail) <span class="roman">…</span>)</code></span>
  <span class="roman">;; <code>fail</code> is <code>(lambda () <span class="roman">…</span>)</code></span>
  <span class="roman">…</span>)
</pre></div>

<p>For example, executing
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(ambeval ⟨<var>exp</var>⟩
         the-global-environment
         (lambda (value fail) value)
         (lambda () 'failed))
</pre></div>

<p>will attempt to evaluate the given expression and will return either the
expression&rsquo;s value (if the evaluation succeeds) or the symbol <code>failed</code> (if
the evaluation fails).  The call to <code>ambeval</code> in the driver loop shown
below uses much more complicated continuation procedures, which continue the
loop and support the <code>try-again</code> request.
</p>
<p>Most of the complexity of the <code>amb</code> evaluator results from the mechanics
of passing the continuations around as the execution procedures call each
other.  In going through the following code, you should compare each of the
execution procedures with the corresponding procedure for the ordinary
evaluator given in <a href="4_002e1.html#g_t4_002e1_002e7">4.1.7</a>.
</p>
<span id="Simple-expressions"></span><h4 class="subsubheading">Simple expressions</h4>

<p>The execution procedures for the simplest kinds of expressions are essentially
the same as those for the ordinary evaluator, except for the need to manage the
continuations.  The execution procedures simply succeed with the value of the
expression, passing along the failure continuation that was passed to them.
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (analyze-self-evaluating exp)
  (lambda (env succeed fail)
    (succeed exp fail)))

(define (analyze-quoted exp)
  (let ((qval (text-of-quotation exp)))
    (lambda (env succeed fail)
      (succeed qval fail))))

(define (analyze-variable exp)
  (lambda (env succeed fail)
    (succeed (lookup-variable-value exp env)
             fail)))

(define (analyze-lambda exp)
  (let ((vars (lambda-parameters exp))
        (bproc (analyze-sequence 
                (lambda-body exp))))
    (lambda (env succeed fail)
      (succeed (make-procedure vars bproc env)
               fail))))
</pre></div>

<p>Notice that looking up a variable always &lsquo;succeeds.&rsquo;  If
<code>lookup-variable-value</code> fails to find the variable, it signals an error,
as usual.  Such a &ldquo;failure&rdquo; indicates a program bug&mdash;a reference to an
unbound variable; it is not an indication that we should try another
nondeterministic choice instead of the one that is currently being tried.
</p>
<span id="Conditionals-and-sequences"></span><h4 class="subsubheading">Conditionals and sequences</h4>

<p>Conditionals are also handled in a similar way as in the ordinary evaluator.
The execution procedure generated by <code>analyze-if</code> invokes the predicate
execution procedure <code>pproc</code> with a success continuation that checks
whether the predicate value is true and goes on to execute either the
consequent or the alternative.  If the execution of <code>pproc</code> fails, the
original failure continuation for the <code>if</code> expression is called.
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (analyze-if exp)
  (let ((pproc (analyze (if-predicate exp)))
        (cproc (analyze (if-consequent exp)))
        (aproc (analyze (if-alternative exp))))
    (lambda (env succeed fail)
      (pproc env
             <span class="roman">;; success continuation for evaluating</span>
             <span class="roman">;; the predicate to obtain <code>pred-value</code></span>
             (lambda (pred-value fail2)
               (if (true? pred-value)
                   (cproc env succeed fail2)
                   (aproc env succeed fail2)))
             <span class="roman">;; failure continuation for</span>
             <span class="roman">;; evaluating the predicate</span>
             fail))))
</pre></div>

<p>Sequences are also handled in the same way as in the previous evaluator, except
for the machinations in the subprocedure <code>sequentially</code> that are required
for passing the continuations.  Namely, to sequentially execute <code>a</code> and
then <code>b</code>, we call <code>a</code> with a success continuation that calls
<code>b</code>.
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (analyze-sequence exps)
  (define (sequentially a b)
    (lambda (env succeed fail)
      (a env
         <span class="roman">;; success continuation for calling <code>a</code></span>
         (lambda (a-value fail2)
           (b env succeed fail2))
         <span class="roman">;; failure continuation for calling <code>a</code></span>
         fail)))
  (define (loop first-proc rest-procs)
    (if (null? rest-procs)
        first-proc
        (loop (sequentially first-proc 
                            (car rest-procs))
              (cdr rest-procs))))
  (let ((procs (map analyze exps)))
    (if (null? procs)
        (error &quot;Empty sequence: ANALYZE&quot;))
    (loop (car procs) (cdr procs))))
</pre></div>

<span id="Definitions-and-assignments"></span><h4 class="subsubheading">Definitions and assignments</h4>

<p>Definitions are another case where we must go to some trouble to manage the
continuations, because it is necessary to evaluate the definition-value
expression before actually defining the new variable.  To accomplish this, the
definition-value execution procedure <code>vproc</code> is called with the
environment, a success continuation, and the failure continuation.  If the
execution of <code>vproc</code> succeeds, obtaining a value <code>val</code> for the
defined variable, the variable is defined and the success is propagated:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (analyze-definition exp)
  (let ((var (definition-variable exp))
        (vproc (analyze 
                (definition-value exp))))
    (lambda (env succeed fail)
      (vproc env
             (lambda (val fail2)
               (define-variable! var val env)
               (succeed 'ok fail2))
             fail))))
</pre></div>

<p>Assignments are more interesting.  This is the first place where we really use
the continuations, rather than just passing them around.  The execution
procedure for assignments starts out like the one for definitions.  It first
attempts to obtain the new value to be assigned to the variable. If this
evaluation of <code>vproc</code> fails, the assignment fails.
</p>
<p>If <code>vproc</code> succeeds, however, and we go on to make the assignment, we must
consider the possibility that this branch of the computation might later fail,
which will require us to backtrack out of the assignment.  Thus, we must
arrange to undo the assignment as part of the backtracking process.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF261" href="#FOOT261"><sup>261</sup></a>
</p>
<p>This is accomplished by giving <code>vproc</code> a success continuation (marked with
the comment &ldquo;*1*&rdquo; below) that saves the old value of the variable before
assigning the new value to the variable and proceeding from the assignment.
The failure continuation that is passed along with the value of the assignment
(marked with the comment &ldquo;*2*&rdquo; below) restores the old value of the variable
before continuing the failure.  That is, a successful assignment provides a
failure continuation that will intercept a subsequent failure; whatever failure
would otherwise have called <code>fail2</code> calls this procedure instead, to undo
the assignment before actually calling <code>fail2</code>.
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (analyze-assignment exp)
  (let ((var (assignment-variable exp))
        (vproc (analyze 
                (assignment-value exp))))
    (lambda (env succeed fail)
      (vproc env
             (lambda (val fail2)    <span class="roman">; *1*</span>
               (let ((old-value
                      (lookup-variable-value 
                       var 
                       env)))
                 (set-variable-value!
                  var

<span id="Procedure-applications"></span><h4 class="subsubheading">Procedure applications</h4>

<p>The execution procedure for applications contains no new ideas except for the
technical complexity of managing the continuations.  This complexity arises in
<code>analyze-application</code>, due to the need to keep track of the success and
failure continuations as we evaluate the operands.  We use a procedure
<code>get-args</code> to evaluate the list of operands, rather than a simple
<code>map</code> as in the ordinary evaluator.
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (analyze-application exp)
  (let ((fproc (analyze (operator exp)))
        (aprocs (map analyze (operands exp))))
    (lambda (env succeed fail)
      (fproc env
             (lambda (proc fail2)
               (get-args 
                aprocs
                env
                (lambda (args fail3)
                  (execute-application
                   proc args succeed fail3))
                fail2))
             fail))))
</pre></div>

<p>In <code>get-args</code>, notice how <code>cdr</code>-ing down the list of <code>aproc</code>
execution procedures and <code>cons</code>ing up the resulting list of <code>args</code> is
accomplished by calling each <code>aproc</code> in the list with a success
continuation that recursively calls <code>get-args</code>.  Each of these recursive
calls to <code>get-args</code> has a success continuation whose value is the
<code>cons</code> of the newly obtained argument onto the list of accumulated
arguments:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (get-args aprocs env succeed fail)
  (if (null? aprocs)
      (succeed '() fail)
      ((car aprocs) 
       env
       ;; <span class="roman">success continuation for this <code>aproc</code></span>
       (lambda (arg fail2)
         (get-args 
          (cdr aprocs)
          env
          ;; <span class="roman">success continuation for</span>
          ;; <span class="roman">recursive call to <code>get-args</code></span>

                     fail3))
          fail2))
       fail)))
</pre></div>

<p>The actual procedure application, which is performed by
<code>execute-application</code>, is accomplished in the same way as for the ordinary
evaluator, except for the need to manage the continuations.

<span id="Evaluating-amb-expressions"></span><h4 class="subsubheading">Evaluating <code>amb</code> expressions</h4>

<p>The <code>amb</code> special form is the key element in the nondeterministic
language.  Here we see the essence of the interpretation process and the reason
for keeping track of the continuations.  The execution procedure for <code>amb</code>
defines a loop <code>try-next</code> that cycles through the execution procedures for
all the possible values of the <code>amb</code> expression.  Each execution procedure
is called with a failure continuation that will try the next one.  When there
are no more alternatives to try, the entire <code>amb</code> expression fails.
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (analyze-amb exp)
  (let ((cprocs
         (map analyze (amb-choices exp))))
    (lambda (env succeed fail)

</pre></div>

<span id="Driver-loop-1"></span><h4 class="subsubheading">Driver loop</h4>

<p>The driver loop for the <code>amb</code> evaluator is complex, due to the mechanism
that permits the user to try again in evaluating an expression.  The driver
uses a procedure called <code>internal-loop</code>, which takes as argument a
procedure <code>try-again</code>.  The intent is that calling <code>try-again</code> should
go on to the next untried alternative in the nondeterministic evaluation.
<code>Internal-loop</code> either calls <code>try-again</code> in response to the user
typing <code>try-again</code> at the driver loop, or else starts a new evaluation by
calling <code>ambeval</code>.
</p>
<p>The failure continuation for this call to <code>ambeval</code> informs the user that
there are no more values and re-invokes the driver loop.
</p>
<p>The success continuation for the call to <code>ambeval</code> is more subtle.  We
print the obtained value and then invoke the internal loop again with a
<code>try-again</code> procedure that will be able to try the next alternative.  This
<code>next-alternative</code> procedure is the second argument that was passed to the
success continuation.  Ordinarily, we think of this second argument as a
failure continuation to be used if the current evaluation branch later fails.
In this case, however, we have completed a successful evaluation, so we can
invoke the &ldquo;failure&rdquo; alternative branch in order to search for additional
successful evaluations.
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define input-prompt  &quot;;;; Amb-Eval input:&quot;)

<p>The initial call to <code>internal-loop</code> uses a <code>try-again</code> procedure that
complains that there is no current problem and restarts the driver loop.  This
is the behavior that will happen if the user types <code>try-again</code> when there
is no evaluation in progress.

We assume that we have previously defined a
procedure <code>prime?</code> that tests whether numbers are prime.  Even with
<code>prime?</code> defined, the <code>prime-sum-pair</code> procedure may look
suspiciously like the unhelpful &ldquo;pseudo-Lisp&rdquo; attempt to define the
square-root function, which we described at the beginning of 
<a href="1_002e1.html#g_t1_002e1_002e7">1.1.7</a>.  In fact, a square-root procedure along those lines can actually
be formulated as a nondeterministic program.  By incorporating a search
mechanism into the evaluator, we are eroding the distinction between purely
declarative descriptions and imperative specifications of how to compute
answers.  We&rsquo;ll go even farther in this direction in <a href="4_002e4.html#g_t4_002e4">4.4</a>.</p>

In
actuality, the distinction between nondeterministically returning a single
choice and returning all choices depends somewhat on our point of view.  From
the perspective of the code that uses the value, the nondeterministic choice
returns a single value.  From the perspective of the programmer designing the
code, the nondeterministic choice potentially returns all possible values, and
the computation branches so that each value is investigated separately.</p>

One
might object that this is a hopelessly inefficient mechanism.  It might require
millions of processors to solve some easily stated problem this way, and most

taken in the context of history.  Memory used to be considered just such an
expensive commodity.  In 1964 a megabyte of <abbr>RAM</abbr> cost about $400,000.  Now every

The integration of 
automatic search strategies into programming languages has had a long and
checkered history.  The first suggestions that nondeterministic algorithms
might be elegantly encoded in a programming language with search and automatic
backtracking came from Robert <a href="References.html#Floyd-_00281967_0029">Floyd (1967)</a>.  Carl <a href="References.html#Hewitt-_00281969_0029">Hewitt (1969)</a> invented a
programming language called Planner that explicitly supported automatic
chronological backtracking, providing for a built-in depth-first search
strategy.  <a href="References.html#Sussman-et-al_002e-_00281971_0029">Sussman et al. (1971)</a> implemented a subset of this
language, called MicroPlanner, which was used to support work in problem
solving and robot planning.  Similar ideas, arising from logic and theorem
proving, led to the genesis in Edinburgh and Marseille of the elegant language
Prolog (which we will discuss in <a href="4_002e4.html#g_t4_002e4">4.4</a>).  After sufficient
frustration with automatic search, <a href="References.html#McDermott-and-Sussman-_00281972_0029">McDermott and Sussman (1972)</a> developed a
language called Conniver, which included mechanisms for placing the search
strategy under programmer control.  This proved unwieldy, however, and <a href="References.html#Sussman-and-Stallman-1975">Sussman and Stallman 1975</a> 
found a more tractable approach while investigating methods
of symbolic analysis for electrical circuits.  They developed a
non-chronological backtracking scheme that was based on tracing out the logical
dependencies connecting facts, a technique that has come to be known as
<span id="index-dependency_002ddirected-backtracking"></span>
<em>dependency-directed backtracking</em>.  Although their method was complex,
it produced reasonably efficient programs because it did little redundant
search.  <a href="References.html#Doyle-_00281979_0029">Doyle (1979)</a> and <a href="References.html#McAllester-_00281978_003b-1980_0029">McAllester (1978; 1980)</a> generalized and clarified the
methods of Stallman and Sussman, developing a new paradigm for formulating
search that is now called <span id="index-truth-maintenance"></span>
<em>truth maintenance</em>.  Modern problem-solving
systems all use some form of truth-maintenance system as a substrate.  See
<a href="References.html#Forbus-and-deKleer-1993">Forbus and deKleer 1993</a> for a discussion of elegant ways to build
truth-maintenance systems and applications using truth maintenance.

that is based on <code>amb</code>; it is similar to the interpreter described in this
section, but more sophisticated, because it uses dependency-directed
backtracking rather than chronological backtracking.  <a href="References.html#Winston-1992">Winston 1992</a> gives an

This kind of grammar can become arbitrarily complex, but it
