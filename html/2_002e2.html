<p>As we have seen, pairs provide a primitive &ldquo;glue&rdquo; that we can use to
construct compound data objects.  <a href="#Figure-2_002e2">Figure 2.2</a> shows a standard way to
visualize a pair&mdash;in this case, the pair formed by <code>(cons 1 2)</code>.  In this
representation, which is called <span id="index-box_002dand_002dpointer-notation"></span>
<em>box-and-pointer notation</em>, each object
is shown as a <span id="index-pointer"></span>
<em>pointer</em> to a box.  The box for a primitive object
contains a representation of the object.  For example, the box for a number
contains a numeral.  The box for a pair is actually a double box, the left part
containing (a pointer to) the <code>car</code> of the pair and the right part
containing the <code>cdr</code>.

<div class="float-caption"><p><strong>Figure 2.2:</strong> Box-and-pointer representation of <code>(cons 1 2)</code>.</p></div></div>
<p>We have already seen that <code>cons</code> can be used to combine not only numbers
but pairs as well.  (You made use of this fact, or should have, in doing
<a href="2_002e1.html#Exercise-2_002e2">Exercise 2.2</a> and <a href="2_002e1.html#Exercise-2_002e3">Exercise 2.3</a>.)  As a consequence, pairs provide a
universal building block from which we can construct all sorts of data
structures.  <a href="#Figure-2_002e3">Figure 2.3</a> shows two ways to use pairs to combine the
numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.
</p>
<div class="float">
<span id="Figure-2_002e3"></span><img src="fig/chap2/Fig2.3e.std.svg" alt="fig/chap2/Fig2.3e">

<div class="float-caption"><p><strong>Figure 2.3:</strong> Two ways to combine 1, 2, 3, and 4 using pairs.</p></div></div>
<p>The ability to create pairs whose elements are pairs is the essence of list
structure&rsquo;s importance as a representational tool.  We refer to this ability as
the <span id="index-closure-property"></span>
<em>closure property</em> of <code>cons</code>.  In general, an operation for
combining data objects satisfies the closure property if the results of
combining things with that operation can themselves be combined using the same
operation.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF72" href="#FOOT72"><sup>72</sup></a> Closure
is the key to power in any means of combination because it permits us to create
<span id="index-hierarchical"></span>
<em>hierarchical</em> structures&mdash;structures made up of parts, which
themselves are made up of parts, and so on.
</p>
<p>From the outset of <a href="Chapter-1.html">Chapter 1</a>, we&rsquo;ve made essential use of closure in
dealing with procedures, because all but the very simplest programs rely on the
fact that the elements of a combination can themselves be combinations.  In
this section, we take up the consequences of closure for compound data.  We
describe some conventional techniques for using pairs to represent sequences
and trees, and we exhibit a graphics language that illustrates closure in a
vivid way.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF73" href="#FOOT73"><sup>73</sup></a>

<p>One of the useful structures we can build with pairs is a
<span id="index-sequence"></span>
<em>sequence</em>&mdash;an ordered collection of data objects.  There are, of
course, many ways to represent sequences in terms of pairs.  One particularly
straightforward representation is illustrated in <a href="#Figure-2_002e4">Figure 2.4</a>, where the
sequence 1, 2, 3, 4 is represented as a chain of pairs.  The <code>car</code> of each
pair is the corresponding item in the chain, and the <code>cdr</code> of the pair is
the next pair in the chain.  The <code>cdr</code> of the final pair signals the end
of the sequence by pointing to a distinguished value that is not a pair,
represented in box-and-pointer diagrams as a diagonal line and in programs as
the value of the variable <code>nil</code>.  The entire sequence is constructed by
nested <code>cons</code> operations:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(cons 1
      (cons 2
            (cons 3
                  (cons 4 nil))))
</pre></div>

<div class="float">
<span id="Figure-2_002e4"></span><img src="fig/chap2/Fig2.4e.std.svg" alt="fig/chap2/Fig2.4e">

<div class="float-caption"><p><strong>Figure 2.4:</strong> The sequence 1, 2, 3, 4 represented as a chain of pairs.</p></div></div>
<p>Such a sequence of pairs, formed by nested <code>cons</code>es, is called a
<span id="index-list"></span>
<em>list</em>, and Scheme provides a primitive called <code>list</code> to help in
constructing lists.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF74" href="#FOOT74"><sup>74</sup></a>  The above sequence could be produced by <code>(list 1 2 3 4)</code>.
In general,
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(list ⟨<var>a₁</var>⟩ ⟨<var>a₂</var>⟩ <span class="roman">…</span> ⟨<var>aₙ</var>⟩)
</pre></div>

<p>is equivalent to
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(cons ⟨<var>a₁</var>⟩
      (cons ⟨<var>a₂</var>⟩
            (cons <span class="roman">…</span>
                  (cons ⟨<var>aₙ</var>⟩
                        nil)<span class="roman">…</span>)))
</pre></div>

<p>Lisp systems conventionally print lists by printing the sequence of elements,
enclosed in parentheses.  Thus, the data object in <a href="#Figure-2_002e4">Figure 2.4</a> is printed
as <code>(1 2 3 4)</code>:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define one-through-four (list 1 2 3 4))

one-through-four
<i>(1 2 3 4)</i>
</pre></div>

<p>Be careful not to confuse the expression <code>(list 1 2 3 4)</code> with the list
<code>(1 2 3 4)</code>, which is the result obtained when the expression is
evaluated.  Attempting to evaluate the expression <code>(1 2 3 4)</code> will signal
an error when the interpreter tries to apply the procedure <code>1</code> to
arguments <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>, <code>4</code>.
</p>
<p>We can think of <code>car</code> as selecting the first item in the list, and of
<code>cdr</code> as selecting the sublist consisting of all but the first item.
Nested applications of <code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code> can be used to extract the
second, third, and subsequent items in the list.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF75" href="#FOOT75"><sup>75</sup></a> The constructor <code>cons</code>
makes a list like the original one, but with an additional item at the
beginning.
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(car one-through-four)
<i>1</i>

(cdr one-through-four)
<i>(2 3 4)</i>

(car (cdr one-through-four))
<i>2</i>

(cons 10 one-through-four)
<i>(10 1 2 3 4)</i>

(cons 5 one-through-four)
<i>(5 1 2 3 4)</i>
</pre></div>

<p>The value of <code>nil</code>, used to terminate the chain of pairs, can be thought
of as a sequence of no elements, the <span id="index-empty-list"></span>
<em>empty list</em>.  The word
<span id="index-nil"></span>
<em>nil</em> is a contraction of the Latin word <em>nihil</em>, which means
&ldquo;nothing.&rdquo;<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF76" href="#FOOT76"><sup>76</sup></a>
</p>
<span id="List-operations"></span><h4 class="subsubheading">List operations</h4>

<p>The use of pairs to represent sequences of elements as lists is accompanied by
conventional programming techniques for manipulating lists by successively
&ldquo;<code>cdr</code>ing down&rdquo; the lists.  For example, the procedure <code>list-ref</code>
takes as arguments a list and a number \( n \) and returns the \( n^{\text{th}} \) item of
the list.  It is customary to number the elements of the list beginning with 0.
The method for computing <code>list-ref</code> is the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li> For \( {n = 0} \), <code>list-ref</code> should return the <code>car</code> of the list.

</li><li> Otherwise, <code>list-ref</code> should return  the \( {(n - 1)} \)-st item of the
<code>cdr</code> of the list.

</li></ul>

<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (list-ref items n)
  (if (= n 0)
      (car items)
      (list-ref (cdr items) 
                (- n 1))))

(define squares 
  (list 1 4 9 16 25))

(list-ref squares 3)
<i>16</i>
</pre></div>

<p>Often we <code>cdr</code> down the whole list.  To aid in this, Scheme includes a
primitive predicate <code>null?</code>, which tests whether its argument is the empty
list.  The procedure <code>length</code>, which returns the number of items in a
list, illustrates this typical pattern of use:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (length items)
  (if (null? items)
      0
      (+ 1 (length (cdr items)))))

(define odds
  (list 1 3 5 7))

(length odds)
<i>4</i>
</pre></div>

<p>The <code>length</code> procedure implements a simple recursive plan. The reduction
step is:
</p>
<ul>
<li> The <code>length</code> of any list is 1 plus the <code>length</code> of the <code>cdr</code> of
the list.

</li></ul>

<p>This is applied successively until we reach the base case:
</p>
<ul>
<li> The <code>length</code> of the empty list is 0.

</li></ul>

<p>We could also compute <code>length</code> in an iterative style:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (length items)
  (define (length-iter a count)
    (if (null? a)
        count
        (length-iter (cdr a) 
                     (+ 1 count))))
  (length-iter items 0))
</pre></div>

<p>Another conventional programming technique is to &ldquo;<code>cons</code> up&rdquo; an answer
list while <code>cdr</code>ing down a list, as in the procedure <code>append</code>, which
takes two lists as arguments and combines their elements to make a new list:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(append squares odds)
<i>(1 4 9 16 25 1 3 5 7)</i>

(append odds squares)
<i>(1 3 5 7 1 4 9 16 25)</i>
</pre></div>

<p><code>Append</code> is also implemented using a recursive plan.  To <code>append</code>
lists <code>list1</code> and <code>list2</code>, do the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li> If <code>list1</code> is the empty list, then the result is just <code>list2</code>.

</li><li> Otherwise, <code>append</code> the <code>cdr</code> of <code>list1</code> and <code>list2</code>, and
<code>cons</code> the <code>car</code> of <code>list1</code> onto the result:

</li></ul>

<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (append list1 list2)
  (if (null? list1)
      list2
      (cons (car list1) 
            (append (cdr list1) 
                    list2))))
</pre></div>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><span id="Exercise-2_002e19"></span>Exercise 2.19:</strong> Consider the change-counting
program of <a href="1_002e2.html#g_t1_002e2_002e2">1.2.2</a>.  It would be nice to be able to easily change
the currency used by the program, so that we could compute the number of ways
to change a British pound, for example.  As the program is written, the
knowledge of the currency is distributed partly into the procedure
<code>first-denomination</code> and partly into the procedure <code>count-change</code>
(which knows that there are five kinds of U.S. coins).  It would be nicer to be
able to supply a list of coins to be used for making change.
</p>
<p>We want to rewrite the procedure <code>cc</code> so that its second argument is a
list of the values of the coins to use rather than an integer specifying which
coins to use.  We could then have lists that defined each kind of currency:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define us-coins 
  (list 50 25 10 5 1))

(define uk-coins 
  (list 100 50 20 10 5 2 1 0.5))
</pre></div>

<p>We could then call <code>cc</code> as follows:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(cc 100 us-coins)
<i>292</i>
</pre></div>

<p>To do this will require changing the program <code>cc</code> somewhat.  It will still
have the same form, but it will access its second argument differently, as
follows:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (cc amount coin-values)
  (cond ((= amount 0) 
         1)
        ((or (&lt; amount 0) 
             (no-more? coin-values)) 
         0)
        (else
         (+ (cc 
             amount
             (except-first-denomination 
              coin-values))
            (cc 
             (- amount
                (first-denomination 
                 coin-values))
             coin-values)))))
</pre></div>

<p>Define the procedures <code>first-denomination</code>,
<code>except-first-denomination</code> and <code>no-more?</code> in terms of primitive
operations on list structures.  Does the order of the list <code>coin-values</code>
affect the answer produced by <code>cc</code>?  Why or why not?
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><span id="Exercise-2_002e20"></span>Exercise 2.20:</strong> The procedures <code>+</code>,
<code>*</code>, and <code>list</code> take arbitrary numbers of arguments. One way to
define such procedures is to use <code>define</code> with <span id="index-dotted_002dtail-notation"></span>
<em>dotted-tail notation</em>.  
In a procedure definition, a parameter list that has a dot before
the last parameter name indicates that, when the procedure is called, the
initial parameters (if any) will have as values the initial arguments, as
usual, but the final parameter&rsquo;s value will be a <span id="index-list-2"></span>
<em>list</em> of any
remaining arguments.  For instance, given the definition
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (f x y . z) ⟨<var>body</var>⟩)
</pre></div>

<p>the procedure <code>f</code> can be called with two or more arguments.  If we
evaluate
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(f 1 2 3 4 5 6)
</pre></div>

<p>then in the body of <code>f</code>, <code>x</code> will be 1, <code>y</code> will be 2, and
<code>z</code> will be the list <code>(3 4 5 6)</code>.  Given the definition
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (g . w) ⟨<var>body</var>⟩)
</pre></div>

<p>the procedure <code>g</code> can be called with zero or more arguments.  If we
evaluate
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(g 1 2 3 4 5 6)
</pre></div>

<p>then in the body of <code>g</code>, <code>w</code> will be the list <code>(1 2 3 4 5
6)</code>.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF77" href="#FOOT77"><sup>77</sup></a>
</p>
<p>Use this notation to write a procedure <code>same-parity</code> that takes one or
more integers and returns a list of all the arguments that have the same
even-odd parity as the first argument.  For example,
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(same-parity 1 2 3 4 5 6 7)
<i>(1 3 5 7)</i>

(same-parity 2 3 4 5 6 7)
<i>(2 4 6)</i>
</pre></div>
</blockquote>

<span id="Mapping-over-lists"></span><h4 class="subsubheading">Mapping over lists</h4>

<p>One extremely useful operation is to apply some transformation to each element
in a list and generate the list of results.  For instance, the following
procedure scales each number in a list by a given factor:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (scale-list items factor)
  (if (null? items)
      nil
      (cons (* (car items) factor)
            (scale-list (cdr items) 
                        factor))))

(scale-list (list 1 2 3 4 5) 10)
<i>(10 20 30 40 50)</i>
</pre></div>

<p>We can abstract this general idea and capture it as a common pattern expressed
as a higher-order procedure, just as in <a href="1_002e3.html#g_t1_002e3">1.3</a>.  The higher-order
procedure here is called <code>map</code>.  <code>Map</code> takes as arguments a procedure
of one argument and a list, and returns a list of the results produced by
applying the procedure to each element in the list:<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF78" href="#FOOT78"><sup>78</sup></a>
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (map proc items)
  (if (null? items)
      nil
      (cons (proc (car items))
            (map proc (cdr items)))))

(map abs (list -10 2.5 -11.6 17))
<i>(10 2.5 11.6 17)</i>

(map (lambda (x) (* x x)) (list 1 2 3 4))
<i>(1 4 9 16)</i>
</pre></div>

<p>Now we can give a new definition of <code>scale-list</code> in terms of <code>map</code>:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (scale-list items factor)
  (map (lambda (x) (* x factor))
       items))
</pre></div>

<p><code>Map</code> is an important construct, not only because it captures a common
pattern, but because it establishes a higher level of abstraction in dealing
with lists.  In the original definition of <code>scale-list</code>, the recursive
structure of the program draws attention to the element-by-element processing
of the list.  Defining <code>scale-list</code> in terms of <code>map</code> suppresses that
level of detail and emphasizes that scaling transforms a list of elements to a
list of results.  The difference between the two definitions is not that the
computer is performing a different process (it isn&rsquo;t) but that we think about
the process differently.  In effect, <code>map</code> helps establish an abstraction
barrier that isolates the implementation of procedures that transform lists
from the details of how the elements of the list are extracted and combined.
Like the barriers shown in <a href="2_002e1.html#Figure-2_002e1">Figure 2.1</a>, this abstraction gives us the
flexibility to change the low-level details of how sequences are implemented,
while preserving the conceptual framework of operations that transform
sequences to sequences.  Section <a href="#g_t2_002e2_002e3">2.2.3</a> expands on this use of sequences
as a framework for organizing programs.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><span id="Exercise-2_002e21"></span>Exercise 2.21:</strong> The procedure <code>square-list</code>

<p><strong><span id="Exercise-2_002e23"></span>Exercise 2.23:</strong> The procedure <code>for-each</code> is

<p>The representation of sequences in terms of lists generalizes naturally to
represent sequences whose elements may themselves be sequences.  For example,
we can regard the object <code>((1 2) 3 4)</code> constructed by
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(cons (list 1 2) (list 3 4))
</pre></div>

<p>as a list of three items, the first of which is itself a list, <code>(1 2)</code>.
Indeed, this is suggested by the form in which the result is printed by the
interpreter.  <a href="#Figure-2_002e5">Figure 2.5</a> shows the representation of
this structure in terms of pairs.

<p>Another way to think of sequences whose elements are sequences is as
<span id="index-trees"></span>
<em>trees</em>.  The elements of the sequence are the branches of the tree,
and elements that are themselves sequences are subtrees.  <a href="#Figure-2_002e6">Figure 2.6</a>

<p>Recursion is a natural tool for dealing with tree structures, since we can
often reduce operations on trees to operations on their branches, which reduce
in turn to operations on the branches of the branches, and so on, until we
reach the leaves of the tree.  As an example, compare the <code>length</code>
procedure of <a href="#g_t2_002e2_002e1">2.2.1</a> with the <code>count-leaves</code> procedure, which
returns the total number of leaves of a tree:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define x (cons (list 1 2) (list 3 4)))
</pre></div>

<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(length x)
<i>3</i>
</pre></div>

<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(count-leaves x)
<i>4</i>

(list x x)
<i>(((1 2) 3 4) ((1 2) 3 4))</i>

(length (list x x))
<i>2</i>

(count-leaves (list x x))
<i>8</i>
</pre></div>

<p>To implement <code>count-leaves</code>, recall the recursive plan for computing
<code>length</code>:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <code>Length</code> of a list <code>x</code> is 1 plus <code>length</code> of the
<code>cdr</code> of <code>x</code>.

</li><li> <code>Length</code> of the empty list is 0.

</li></ul>

<p><code>Count-leaves</code> is similar.  The value for the empty list is the same:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <code>Count-leaves</code> of the empty list is 0.

</li></ul>

<p>But in the reduction step, where we strip off the <code>car</code> of the list, we
must take into account that the <code>car</code> may itself be a tree whose leaves we
need to count.  Thus, the appropriate reduction step is
</p>
<ul>
<li> <code>Count-leaves</code> of a tree <code>x</code> is <code>count-leaves</code> of the <code>car</code>
of <code>x</code> plus <code>count-leaves</code> of the <code>cdr</code> of <code>x</code>.

</li></ul>

<p>Finally, by taking <code>car</code>s we reach actual leaves, so we need another base
case:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <code>Count-leaves</code> of a leaf is 1.

</li></ul>

<p>To aid in writing recursive procedures on trees, Scheme provides the primitive
predicate <code>pair?</code>, which tests whether its argument is a pair.  Here is
the complete procedure:<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF79" href="#FOOT79"><sup>79</sup></a>

<span id="Mapping-over-trees"></span><h4 class="subsubheading">Mapping over trees</h4>

<p>Just as <code>map</code> is a powerful abstraction for dealing with sequences,
<code>map</code> together with recursion is a powerful abstraction for dealing with
trees.  For instance, the <code>scale-tree</code> procedure, analogous to
<code>scale-list</code> of <a href="#g_t2_002e2_002e1">2.2.1</a>, takes as arguments a numeric factor
and a tree whose leaves are numbers.  It returns a tree of the same shape,
where each number is multiplied by the factor.  The recursive plan for
<code>scale-tree</code> is similar to the one for <code>count-leaves</code>:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (scale-tree tree factor)
  (cond ((null? tree) nil)
        ((not (pair? tree)) 
         (* tree factor))
        (else
         (cons (scale-tree (car tree) 
                           factor)
               (scale-tree (cdr tree) 
                           factor)))))

            10)

<i>(10 (20 (30 40) 50) (60 70))</i>
</pre></div>

<p>Another way to implement <code>scale-tree</code> is to regard the tree as a sequence
of sub-trees and use <code>map</code>.  We map over the sequence, scaling each
sub-tree in turn, and return the list of results.  In the base case, where the
tree is a leaf, we simply multiply by the factor:
</p>
<div class="lisp">

<p>In working with compound data, we&rsquo;ve stressed how data abstraction permits us
to design programs without becoming enmeshed in the details of data
representations, and how abstraction preserves for us the flexibility to
experiment with alternative representations.  In this section, we introduce
another powerful design principle for working with data structures&mdash;the use of
<span id="index-conventional-interfaces-1"></span>
<em>conventional interfaces</em>.
</p>
<p>In <a href="1_002e3.html#g_t1_002e3">1.3</a> we saw how program abstractions, implemented as
higher-order procedures, can capture common patterns in programs that deal with
numerical data.  Our ability to formulate analogous operations for working with
compound data depends crucially on the style in which we manipulate our data
structures.  Consider, for example, the following procedure, analogous to the
<code>count-leaves</code> procedure of <a href="#g_t2_002e2_002e2">2.2.2</a>, which takes a tree as
argument and computes the sum of the squares of the leaves that are odd:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (sum-odd-squares tree)
  (cond ((null? tree) 0)
        ((not (pair? tree))
         (if (odd? tree) (square tree) 0))
        (else (+ (sum-odd-squares 
                  (car tree))
                 (sum-odd-squares 
                  (cdr tree))))))
</pre></div>

<p>On the surface, this procedure is very different from the following one, which
constructs a list of all the even Fibonacci numbers \( {\text{Fib}(k)} \), where
\( k \) is less than or equal to a given integer \( n \):
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (even-fibs n)
  (define (next k)
    (if (&gt; k n)
        nil
        (let ((f (fib k)))
          (if (even? f)
              (cons f (next (+ k 1)))
              (next (+ k 1))))))
  (next 0))
</pre></div>

<p>Despite the fact that these two procedures are structurally very different, a
more abstract description of the two computations reveals a great deal of
similarity.  The first program
</p>
<ul>
<li> enumerates the leaves of a tree;

</li><li> filters them, selecting the odd ones;

</li><li> squares each of the selected ones; and

</li><li> accumulates the results using <code>+</code>, starting with 0.

</li></ul>

<p>The second program
</p>
<ul>
<li> enumerates the integers from 0 to \( n \);

</li><li> computes the Fibonacci number for each integer;

</li><li> filters them, selecting the even ones; and

</li><li> accumulates the results using <code>cons</code>,  starting with the
empty list.

</li></ul>

<p>A signal-processing engineer would find it natural to conceptualize these
processes in terms of signals flowing through a cascade of stages, each of
which implements part of the program plan, as shown in <a href="#Figure-2_002e7">Figure 2.7</a>.  In
<code>sum-odd-squares</code>, we begin with an <span id="index-enumerator"></span>
<em>enumerator</em>, which generates
a &ldquo;signal&rdquo; consisting of the leaves of a given tree.  This signal is passed
through a <span id="index-filter-1"></span>
<em>filter</em>, which eliminates all but the odd elements.  The
resulting signal is in turn passed through a <span id="index-map"></span>
<em>map</em>, which is a
&ldquo;transducer&rdquo; that applies the <code>square</code> procedure to each element.  The
output of the map is then fed to an <span id="index-accumulator"></span>
<em>accumulator</em>, which combines the
elements using <code>+</code>, starting from an initial 0.  The plan for
<code>even-fibs</code> is analogous.

<div class="float-caption"><p><strong>Figure 2.7:</strong> The signal-flow plans for the procedures <code>sum-odd-squares</code> (top) and <code>even-fibs</code> (bottom) reveal the commonality between the two programs.</p></div></div>
<p>Unfortunately, the two procedure definitions above fail to exhibit this
signal-flow structure.  For instance, if we examine the <code>sum-odd-squares</code>
procedure, we find that the enumeration is implemented partly by the
<code>null?</code> and <code>pair?</code> tests and partly by the tree-recursive structure
of the procedure.  Similarly, the accumulation is found partly in the tests and
partly in the addition used in the recursion.  In general, there are no
distinct parts of either procedure that correspond to the elements in the
signal-flow description.  Our two procedures decompose the computations in a
different way, spreading the enumeration over the program and mingling it with
the map, the filter, and the accumulation.  If we could organize our programs
to make the signal-flow structure manifest in the procedures we write, this
would increase the conceptual clarity of the resulting code.
</p>
<span id="Sequence-Operations"></span><h4 class="subsubheading">Sequence Operations</h4>

<p>The key to organizing programs so as to more clearly reflect the signal-flow
structure is to concentrate on the &ldquo;signals&rdquo; that flow from one stage in the
process to the next.  If we represent these signals as lists, then we can use
list operations to implement the processing at each of the stages.  For
instance, we can implement the mapping stages of the signal-flow diagrams using
the <code>map</code> procedure from <a href="#g_t2_002e2_002e1">2.2.1</a>:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(map square (list 1 2 3 4 5))
<i>(1 4 9 16 25)</i>
</pre></div>

<p>Filtering a sequence to select only those elements that satisfy a given
predicate is accomplished by
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (filter predicate sequence)
  (cond ((null? sequence) nil)
        ((predicate (car sequence))
         (cons (car sequence)
               (filter predicate 
                       (cdr sequence))))
        (else  (filter predicate 
                       (cdr sequence)))))
</pre></div>

<p>For example,
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(filter odd? (list 1 2 3 4 5))
<i>(1 3 5)</i>
</pre></div>

<p>Accumulations can be implemented by
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (accumulate op initial sequence)
  (if (null? sequence)
      initial
      (op (car sequence)
          (accumulate op 
                      initial 
                      (cdr sequence)))))

(accumulate + 0 (list 1 2 3 4 5))
<i>15</i>
(accumulate * 1 (list 1 2 3 4 5))
<i>120</i>
(accumulate cons nil (list 1 2 3 4 5))
<i>(1 2 3 4 5)</i>
</pre></div>

<p>All that remains to implement signal-flow diagrams is to enumerate the sequence
of elements to be processed.  For <code>even-fibs</code>, we need to generate the
sequence of integers in a given range, which we can do as follows:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (enumerate-interval low high)
  (if (&gt; low high)
      nil
      (cons low 
            (enumerate-interval 
             (+ low 1) 
             high))))

(enumerate-interval 2 7)
<i>(2 3 4 5 6 7)</i>
</pre></div>

<p>To enumerate the leaves of a tree, we can use<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF80" href="#FOOT80"><sup>80</sup></a>
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (enumerate-tree tree)
  (cond ((null? tree) nil)
        ((not (pair? tree)) (list tree))
        (else (append 
               (enumerate-tree (car tree))
               (enumerate-tree (cdr tree))))))

(enumerate-tree (list 1 (list 2 (list 3 4)) 5))
<i>(1 2 3 4 5)</i>
</pre></div>

<p>Now we can reformulate <code>sum-odd-squares</code> and <code>even-fibs</code> as in the
signal-flow diagrams.  For <code>sum-odd-squares</code>, we enumerate the sequence of
leaves of the tree, filter this to keep only the odd numbers in the sequence,
square each element, and sum the results:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (sum-odd-squares tree)
  (accumulate 
   +
   0
   (map square
        (filter odd?
                (enumerate-tree tree)))))
</pre></div>

<p>For <code>even-fibs</code>, we enumerate the integers from 0 to \( n \), generate the
Fibonacci number for each of these integers, filter the resulting sequence to
keep only the even elements, and accumulate the results into a list:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (even-fibs n)
  (accumulate 
   cons
   nil
   (filter even?
           (map fib
                (enumerate-interval 0 n)))))
</pre></div>

<p>The value of expressing programs as sequence operations is that this helps us
make program designs that are modular, that is, designs that are constructed by
combining relatively independent pieces.  We can encourage modular design by
providing a library of standard components together with a conventional
interface for connecting the components in flexible ways.
</p>
<p>Modular construction is a powerful strategy for controlling complexity in
engineering design.  In real signal-processing applications, for example,
designers regularly build systems by cascading elements selected from
standardized families of filters and transducers.  Similarly, sequence
operations provide a library of standard program elements that we can mix and
match.  For instance, we can reuse pieces from the <code>sum-odd-squares</code> and
<code>even-fibs</code> procedures in a program that constructs a list of the squares
of the first \( {n + 1} \) Fibonacci numbers:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (list-fib-squares n)
  (accumulate 
   cons
   nil
   (map square
        (map fib
             (enumerate-interval 0 n)))))

(list-fib-squares 10)
<i>(0 1 1 4 9 25 64 169 441 1156 3025)</i>
</pre></div>

<p>We can rearrange the pieces and use them in computing the product of the squares of the odd

   1

(product-of-squares-of-odd-elements 
 (list 1 2 3 4 5))
<i>225</i>
</pre></div>

<p>We can also formulate conventional data-processing applications in terms of
sequence operations.  Suppose we have a sequence of personnel records and we
want to find the salary of the highest-paid programmer.  Assume that we have a
selector <code>salary</code> that returns the salary of a record, and a predicate
<code>programmer?</code> that tests if a record is for a programmer.  Then we can
write
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define 
  (salary-of-highest-paid-programmer
   records)
  (accumulate 
   max
   0
   (map salary
        (filter programmer? records))))
</pre></div>

<p>These examples give just a hint of the vast range of operations that can be
expressed as sequence operations.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF81" href="#FOOT81"><sup>81</sup></a>
</p>
<p>Sequences, implemented here as lists, serve as a conventional interface that
permits us to combine processing modules.  Additionally, when we uniformly
represent structures as sequences, we have localized the data-structure
dependencies in our programs to a small number of sequence operations.  By
changing these, we can experiment with alternative representations of
sequences, while leaving the overall design of our programs intact.  We will
exploit this capability in <a href="3_002e5.html#g_t3_002e5">3.5</a>, when we generalize the
sequence-processing paradigm to admit infinite sequences.

<span id="Nested-Mappings"></span><h4 class="subsubheading">Nested Mappings</h4>

<p>We can extend the sequence paradigm to include many computations that are
commonly expressed using nested loops.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF84" href="#FOOT84"><sup>84</sup></a> Consider this problem: Given a positive integer \( n \), find all
ordered pairs of distinct positive integers \( i \) and \( j \), where 
\( {1 \le j} &lt; {i \le n} \), such that \( {i + j} \) is prime.  For example, if \( n \) is 6,
then the pairs are the following:
\[ % :39:
 
\begin{array}{c|ccccccc}
i 	&amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 &amp; 6 \\
j 	&amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 3 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 5 \\
\hline
i + j	&amp; 3 &amp; 5 &amp; 5 &amp; 7 &amp; 7 &amp; 7 &amp; 11 
\end{array}
\]
A natural way to organize this computation is to generate the sequence of all
ordered pairs of positive integers less than or equal to \( n \), filter to
select those pairs whose sum is prime, and then, for each pair \( {(i, j)} \)
that passes through the filter, produce the triple \( {(i, j, i + j)} \).
</p>
<p>Here is a way to generate the sequence of pairs: For each integer \( {i \le n} \), 
enumerate the integers \( {j &lt; i} \), and for each such \( i \) and \( j \)
generate the pair \( {(i, j)} \).  In terms of sequence operations, we map along
the sequence <code>(enumerate-interval 1 n)</code>.  For each \( i \) in this sequence,
we map along the sequence <code>(enumerate-interval 1 (- i 1))</code>.  For each
\( j \) in this latter sequence, we generate the pair <code>(list i j)</code>.  This
gives us a sequence of pairs for each \( i \).  Combining all the sequences for
all the \( i \) (by accumulating with <code>append</code>) produces the required
sequence of pairs:<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF85" href="#FOOT85"><sup>85</sup></a>
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(accumulate 
 append
 nil
 (map (lambda (i)
        (map (lambda (j) 
               (list i j))
             (enumerate-interval 1 (- i 1))))
      (enumerate-interval 1 n)))
</pre></div>

<p>The combination of mapping and accumulating with <code>append</code> is so common in
this sort of program that we will isolate it as a separate procedure:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (flatmap proc seq)
  (accumulate append nil (map proc seq)))
</pre></div>

<p>Now filter this sequence of pairs to find those whose sum is prime. The filter
predicate is called for each element of the sequence; its argument is a pair
and it must extract the integers from the pair.  Thus, the predicate to apply
to each element in the sequence is
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (prime-sum? pair)
  (prime? (+ (car pair) (cadr pair))))
</pre></div>

<p>Finally, generate the sequence of results by mapping over the filtered pairs
using the following procedure, which constructs a triple consisting of the two
elements of the pair along with their sum:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (make-pair-sum pair)
  (list (car pair) 
        (cadr pair) 
        (+ (car pair) (cadr pair))))
</pre></div>

<p>Combining all these steps yields the complete procedure:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (prime-sum-pairs n)
  (map make-pair-sum
       (filter 
        prime-sum?
        (flatmap
         (lambda (i)
           (map (lambda (j) 
                  (list i j))
                (enumerate-interval 
                 1 
                 (- i 1))))
         (enumerate-interval 1 n)))))
</pre></div>

<p>Nested mappings are also useful for sequences other than those that enumerate
intervals.  Suppose we wish to generate all the permutations of a set \( {S;} \)
that is, all the ways of ordering the items in the set.  For instance, the
permutations of \( {\{1, 2, 3\}} \) are \( {\{1, 2, 3\}} \), \( {\{1, 3, 2\}} \), \( {\{2, 1, 3\}} \), \( {\{2, 3, 1\}} \),
\( {\{3, 1, 2\}} \), and \( {\{3, 2, 1\}} \).  Here is a plan for generating the permutations of
\( S \): For each item \( x \) in \( S \), recursively generate the sequence of
permutations of \( {S - x} \),<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF86" href="#FOOT86"><sup>86</sup></a> and adjoin \( x \) to the front of each one.
This yields, for each \( x \) in \( S \), the sequence of permutations of \( S \)
that begin with \( x \).  Combining these sequences for all \( x \) gives all the
permutations of \( S \):<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF87" href="#FOOT87"><sup>87</sup></a>
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (permutations s)
  (if (null? s)   <span class="roman">; empty set?</span>
      (list nil)  <span class="roman">; sequence containing empty set</span>
      (flatmap (lambda (x)
                 (map (lambda (p) 
                        (cons x p))
                      (permutations 
                       (remove x s))))
               s)))
</pre></div>

<p>Notice how this strategy reduces the problem of generating permutations of
\( S \) to the problem of generating the permutations of sets with fewer elements
than \( S \).  In the terminal case, we work our way down to the empty list,
which represents a set of no elements.  For this, we generate <code>(list
nil)</code>, which is a sequence with one item, namely the set with no elements.  The
<code>remove</code> procedure used in <code>permutations</code> returns all the items in a
given sequence except for a given item.  This can be expressed as a simple
filter:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (remove item sequence)
  (filter (lambda (x) (not (= x item)))
          sequence))

other (i.e., no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal).  One
possible solution is shown in <a href="#Figure-2_002e8">Figure 2.8</a>.  One way to solve the puzzle is
to work across the board, placing a queen in each column.  Once we have placed
\( {k - 1} \) queens, we must place the \( k^{\text{th}} \) queen in a position where it does
not check any of the queens already on the board.  We can formulate this
approach recursively: Assume that we have already generated the sequence of all
possible ways to place \( {k - 1} \) queens in the first \( {k - 1} \) columns of the
board.  For each of these ways, generate an extended set of positions by
placing a queen in each row of the \( k^{\text{th}} \) column.  Now filter these, keeping
only the positions for which the queen in the \( k^{\text{th}} \) column is safe with
respect to the other queens.  This produces the sequence of all ways to place
\( k \) queens in the first \( k \) columns.  By continuing this process, we will
produce not only one solution, but all solutions to the puzzle.

<p>When we began our study of programming in <a href="1_002e1.html#g_t1_002e1">1.1</a>, we emphasized the
importance of describing a language by focusing on the language&rsquo;s primitives,
its means of combination, and its means of abstraction.  We&rsquo;ll follow that
framework here.
</p>
<p>Part of the elegance of this picture language is that there is only one kind of
element, called a <span id="index-painter"></span>
<em>painter</em>.  A painter draws an image that is shifted
and scaled to fit within a designated parallelogram-shaped frame.  For example,
there&rsquo;s a primitive painter we&rsquo;ll call <code>wave</code> that makes a crude line
drawing, as shown in <a href="#Figure-2_002e10">Figure 2.10</a>.  The actual shape of the drawing
depends on the frame&mdash;all four images in figure 2.10 are produced by the
same <code>wave</code> painter, but with respect to four different frames.  Painters
can be more elaborate than this: The primitive painter called <code>rogers</code>
paints a picture of <abbr>MIT</abbr>&rsquo;s founder, William Barton Rogers, as shown in
<a href="#Figure-2_002e11">Figure 2.11</a>.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF89" href="#FOOT89"><sup>89</sup></a> The four images in figure 2.11 are drawn with respect to the same four
frames as the <code>wave</code> images in figure 2.10.

<p>To combine images, we use various operations that construct new painters from
given painters.  For example, the <code>beside</code> operation takes two painters
and produces a new, compound painter that draws the first painter&rsquo;s image in
the left half of the frame and the second painter&rsquo;s image in the right half of
the frame.  Similarly, <code>below</code> takes two painters and produces a compound
painter that draws the first painter&rsquo;s image below the second painter&rsquo;s image.
Some operations transform a single painter to produce a new painter.  For
example, <code>flip-vert</code> takes a painter and produces a painter that draws its
image upside-down, and <code>flip-horiz</code> produces a painter that draws the
original painter&rsquo;s image left-to-right reversed.

<p><a href="#Figure-2_002e12">Figure 2.12</a> shows the drawing of a painter called

<p>In building up a complex image in this manner we are exploiting the fact that
painters are closed under the language&rsquo;s means of combination.  The
<code>beside</code> or <code>below</code> of two painters is itself a painter; therefore,
we can use it as an element in making more complex painters.  As with building
up list structure using <code>cons</code>, the closure of our data under the means of
combination is crucial to the ability to create complex structures while using
only a few operations.
</p>
<p>Once we can combine painters, we would like to be able to abstract typical
patterns of combining painters.  We will implement the painter operations as
Scheme procedures.  This means that we don&rsquo;t need a special abstraction
mechanism in the picture language: Since the means of combination are ordinary
Scheme procedures, we automatically have the capability to do anything with
painter operations that we can do with procedures.  For example, we can
abstract the pattern in <code>wave4</code> as
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (flipped-pairs painter)
  (let ((painter2 
         (beside painter

</pre></div>

<p>and define <code>wave4</code> as an instance of this pattern:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define wave4 (flipped-pairs wave))

<p>We can also define recursive operations.  Here&rsquo;s one that makes painters split

<span id="Higher_002dorder-operations"></span><h4 class="subsubheading">Higher-order operations</h4>

<p>In addition to abstracting patterns of combining painters, we can work at a
higher level, abstracting patterns of combining painter operations.  That is,
we can view the painter operations as elements to manipulate and can write
means of combination for these elements&mdash;procedures that take painter
operations as arguments and create new painter operations.
</p>
<p>For example, <code>flipped-pairs</code> and <code>square-limit</code> each arrange four
copies of a painter&rsquo;s image in a square pattern; they differ only in how they
orient the copies.  One way to abstract this pattern of painter combination is
with the following procedure, which takes four one-argument painter operations
and produces a painter operation that transforms a given painter with those
four operations and arranges the results in a square.  <code>Tl</code>, <code>tr</code>,
<code>bl</code>, and <code>br</code> are the transformations to apply to the top left copy,
the top right copy, the bottom left copy, and the bottom right copy,
respectively.
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (square-of-four tl tr bl br)

<span id="Frames"></span><h4 class="subsubheading">Frames</h4>

<p>Before we can show how to implement painters and their means of combination, we
must first consider frames.  A frame can be described by three vectors&mdash;an
origin vector and two edge vectors.  The origin vector specifies the offset of
the frame&rsquo;s origin from some absolute origin in the plane, and the edge vectors
specify the offsets of the frame&rsquo;s corners from its origin.  If the edges are
perpendicular, the frame will be rectangular.  Otherwise the frame will be a
more general parallelogram.
</p>
<p><a href="#Figure-2_002e15">Figure 2.15</a> shows a frame and its associated vectors.
In accordance with data abstraction, we need not be specific yet about how
frames are represented, other than to say that there is a constructor
<code>make-frame</code>, which takes three vectors and produces a frame, and three
corresponding selectors <code>origin-frame</code>, <code>edge1-frame</code>, and
<code>edge2-frame</code> (see <a href="#Exercise-2_002e47">Exercise 2.47</a>).
</p>
<div class="float">
<span id="Figure-2_002e15"></span><img src="fig/chap2/Fig2.15a.std.svg" alt="fig/chap2/Fig2.15a">

<div class="float-caption"><p><strong>Figure 2.15:</strong> A frame is described by three vectors &mdash; an origin and two edges.</p></div></div>
<p>We will use coordinates in the unit square \( {(0 \le x, y \le 1)} \) to specify
images.  With each frame, we associate a <span id="index-frame-coordinate-map"></span>
<em>frame coordinate map</em>, which
will be used to shift and scale images to fit the frame.  The map transforms
the unit square into the frame by mapping the vector \( {{\bf v} = (x, y)} \) to
the vector sum
\[ % :40:
  {\text{Origin(Frame)}} + {x \cdot \text{Edge}_1\text{(Frame)}} + {y \cdot \text{Edge}_2\text{(Frame)}.} \]
For example, (0, 0) is mapped to the origin of the frame, (1, 1) to the vertex
diagonally opposite the origin, and (0.5, 0.5) to the center of the frame.  We
can create a frame&rsquo;s coordinate map with the following
procedure:<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF92" href="#FOOT92"><sup>92</sup></a>
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (frame-coord-map frame)
  (lambda (v)
    (add-vect
     (origin-frame frame)
     (add-vect

                  (edge1-frame frame))
      (scale-vect (ycor-vect v)
                  (edge2-frame frame))))))
</pre></div>

<p>Observe that applying <code>frame-coord-map</code> to a frame returns a procedure
that, given a vector, returns a vector.  If the argument vector is in the unit
square, the result vector will be in the frame.  For example,
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">((frame-coord-map a-frame) (make-vect 0 0))
</pre></div>

<p>returns the same vector as
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(origin-frame a-frame)
</pre></div>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><span id="Exercise-2_002e46"></span>Exercise 2.46:</strong> A two-dimensional vector \( \bf v \)

<code>xcor-vect</code> and <code>ycor-vect</code>.  In terms of your selectors and
constructor, implement procedures <code>add-vect</code>, <code>sub-vect</code>, and
<code>scale-vect</code> that perform the operations vector addition, vector
subtraction, and multiplying a vector by a scalar:

<p>For each constructor supply the appropriate selectors to produce an

</p></blockquote>

<span id="Painters"></span><h4 class="subsubheading">Painters</h4>

<p>A painter is represented as a procedure that, given a frame as argument, draws
a particular image shifted and scaled to fit the frame.  That is to say, if
<code>p</code> is a painter and <code>f</code> is a frame, then we produce <code>p</code>&rsquo;s image
in <code>f</code> by calling <code>p</code> with <code>f</code> as argument.
</p>
<p>The details of how primitive painters are implemented depend on the particular
characteristics of the graphics system and the type of image to be drawn.  For
instance, suppose we have a procedure <code>draw-line</code> that draws a line on the
screen between two specified points.  Then we can create painters for line
drawings, such as the <code>wave</code> painter in <a href="#Figure-2_002e10">Figure 2.10</a>, from lists of
line segments as follows:<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF93" href="#FOOT93"><sup>93</sup></a>
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (segments-&gt;painter segment-list)
  (lambda (frame)

         (start-segment segment))
        ((frame-coord-map frame) 
         (end-segment segment))))
     segment-list)))
</pre></div>

<p>The segments are given using coordinates with respect to the unit square.  For
each segment in the list, the painter transforms the segment endpoints with the
frame coordinate map and draws a line between the transformed points.
</p>
<p>Representing painters as procedures erects a powerful abstraction barrier in
the picture language.  We can create and intermix all sorts of primitive
painters, based on a variety of graphics capabilities. The details of their
implementation do not matter.  Any procedure can serve as a painter, provided
that it takes a frame as argument and draws something scaled to fit the
frame.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF94" href="#FOOT94"><sup>94</sup></a>

<span id="Transforming-and-combining-painters"></span><h4 class="subsubheading">Transforming and combining painters</h4>

<p>An operation on painters (such as <code>flip-vert</code> or <code>beside</code>) works by
creating a painter that invokes the original painters with respect to frames
derived from the argument frame.  Thus, for example, <code>flip-vert</code> doesn&rsquo;t
have to know how a painter works in order to flip it&mdash;it just has to know how
to turn a frame upside down: The flipped painter just uses the original
painter, but in the inverted frame.
</p>
<p>Painter operations are based on the procedure <code>transform-painter</code>, which
takes as arguments a painter and information on how to transform a frame and
produces a new painter.  The transformed painter, when called on a frame,
transforms the frame and calls the original painter on the transformed frame.
The arguments to <code>transform-painter</code> are points (represented as vectors)
that specify the corners of the new frame: When mapped into the frame, the
first point specifies the new frame&rsquo;s origin and the other two specify the ends
of its edge vectors.  Thus, arguments within the unit square specify a frame
contained within the original frame.
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (transform-painter 
         painter origin corner1 corner2)
  (lambda (frame)
    (let ((m (frame-coord-map frame)))
      (let ((new-origin (m origin)))
        (painter (make-frame new-origin
                  (sub-vect (m corner1) 
                            new-origin)
                  (sub-vect (m corner2)
                            new-origin)))))))
</pre></div>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how to flip painter images vertically:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (flip-vert painter)
  (transform-painter 
   painter
   (make-vect 0.0 1.0)   <span class="roman">; new <code>origin</code></span>
   (make-vect 1.0 1.0)   <span class="roman">; new end of <code>edge1</code></span>
   (make-vect 0.0 0.0))) <span class="roman">; new end of <code>edge2</code></span>
</pre></div>

<p>Using <code>transform-painter</code>, we can easily define new transformations.
For example, we can define a painter that shrinks its image to the
upper-right quarter of the frame it is given:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (shrink-to-upper-right painter)
  (transform-painter painter
                     (make-vect 0.5 0.5)
                     (make-vect 1.0 0.5)
                     (make-vect 0.5 1.0)))
</pre></div>

<p>Other transformations rotate images counterclockwise by 90
degrees<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF95" href="#FOOT95"><sup>95</sup></a>
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (rotate90 painter)
  (transform-painter painter
                     (make-vect 1.0 0.0)
                     (make-vect 1.0 1.0)
                     (make-vect 0.0 0.0)))
</pre></div>

<p>or squash images towards the center of the frame:<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF96" href="#FOOT96"><sup>96</sup></a>
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (squash-inwards painter)
  (transform-painter painter
                     (make-vect 0.0 0.0)
                     (make-vect 0.65 0.35)
                     (make-vect 0.35 0.65)))
</pre></div>

<p>Frame transformation is also the key to defining means of combining two or more
painters.  The <code>beside</code> procedure, for example, takes two painters,
transforms them to paint in the left and right halves of an argument frame
respectively, and produces a new, compound painter.  When the compound painter
is given a frame, it calls the first transformed painter to paint in the left
half of the frame and calls the second transformed painter to paint in the
right half of the frame:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (beside painter1 painter2)
  (let ((split-point (make-vect 0.5 0.0)))
    (let ((paint-left  (transform-painter 
                        painter1
                        (make-vect 0.0 0.0)
                        split-point
                        (make-vect 0.0 1.0)))
          (paint-right (transform-painter
                        painter2
                        split-point
                        (make-vect 1.0 0.0)

      (lambda (frame)
        (paint-left frame)
        (paint-right frame)))))
</pre></div>

<p>Observe how the painter data abstraction, and in particular the representation
of painters as procedures, makes <code>beside</code> easy to implement.  The
<code>beside</code> procedure need not know anything about the details of the
component painters other than that each painter will draw something in its
designated frame.

<span id="Levels-of-language-for-robust-design"></span><h4 class="subsubheading">Levels of language for robust design</h4>

<p>The picture language exercises some of the critical ideas we&rsquo;ve introduced
about abstraction with procedures and data.  The fundamental data abstractions,
painters, are implemented using procedural representations, which enables the
language to handle different basic drawing capabilities in a uniform way.  The
means of combination satisfy the closure property, which permits us to easily
build up complex designs.  Finally, all the tools for abstracting procedures
are available to us for abstracting means of combination for painters.
</p>
<p>We have also obtained a glimpse of another crucial idea about languages and
program design.  This is the approach of <span id="index-stratified-design"></span>
<em>stratified design</em>, the
notion that a complex system should be structured as a sequence of levels that
are described using a sequence of languages.  Each level is constructed by
combining parts that are regarded as primitive at that level, and the parts
constructed at each level are used as primitives at the next level.  The
language used at each level of a stratified design has primitives, means of
combination, and means of abstraction appropriate to that level of detail.
</p>
<p>Stratified design pervades the engineering of complex systems.  For example, in
computer engineering, resistors and transistors are combined (and described
using a language of analog circuits) to produce parts such as and-gates and
or-gates, which form the primitives of a language for digital-circuit
design.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF97" href="#FOOT97"><sup>97</sup></a> These parts
are combined to build processors, bus structures, and memory systems, which are
in turn combined to form computers, using languages appropriate to computer
architecture.  Computers are combined to form distributed systems, using
languages appropriate for describing network interconnections, and so on.
</p>
<p>As a tiny example of stratification, our picture language uses primitive
elements (primitive painters) that are created using a language that specifies
points and lines to provide the lists of line segments for
<code>segments-&gt;painter</code>, or the shading details for a painter like
<code>rogers</code>.  The bulk of our description of the picture language focused on
combining these primitives, using geometric combiners such as <code>beside</code> and
<code>below</code>.  We also worked at a higher level, regarding <code>beside</code> and
<code>below</code> as primitives to be manipulated in a language whose operations,
such as <code>square-of-four</code>, capture common patterns of combining geometric
combiners.
</p>
<p>Stratified design helps make programs <span id="index-robust"></span>
<em>robust</em>, that is, it makes it
likely that small changes in a specification will require correspondingly small
changes in the program.  For instance, suppose we wanted to change the image
based on <code>wave</code> shown in <a href="#Figure-2_002e9">Figure 2.9</a>.  We could work at the lowest
level to change the detailed appearance of the <code>wave</code> element; we could
work at the middle level to change the way <code>corner-split</code> replicates the
<code>wave</code>; we could work at the highest level to change how
<code>square-limit</code> arranges the four copies of the corner.  In general, each
level of a stratified design provides a different vocabulary for expressing the
characteristics of the system, and a different kind of ability to change it.

only one copy of the <code>up-split</code> and <code>right-split</code> images instead of
two).

</li><li> Modify the version of <code>square-limit</code> that uses <code>square-of-four</code> so as
to assemble the corners in a different pattern.  (For example, you might make

The use of the word &ldquo;closure&rdquo; here comes from abstract
algebra, where a set of elements is said to be closed under an operation if
applying the operation to elements in the set produces an element that is again
an element of the set.  The Lisp community also (unfortunately) uses the word
&ldquo;closure&rdquo; to describe a totally unrelated concept: A closure is an
implementation technique for representing procedures with free variables.  We
do not use the word &ldquo;closure&rdquo; in this second sense in this book.  </p>
</div>
<div id="FOOT73"><p><a class="footnote_backlink" href="#DOCF73"><sup>73</sup></a>
The notion that a means of combination should satisfy
closure is a straightforward idea.  Unfortunately, the data combiners provided
in many popular programming languages do not satisfy closure, or make closure
cumbersome to exploit.  In Fortran or Basic, one typically combines data
elements by assembling them into arrays&mdash;but one cannot form arrays whose
elements are themselves arrays.  Pascal and C admit structures whose elements
are structures.  However, this requires that the programmer manipulate pointers
explicitly, and adhere to the restriction that each field of a structure can
contain only elements of a prespecified form.  Unlike Lisp with its pairs,
these languages have no built-in general-purpose glue that makes it easy to
manipulate compound data in a uniform way.  This limitation lies behind Alan
Perlis&rsquo;s comment in his foreword to this book: &ldquo;In Pascal the plethora of
declarable data structures induces a specialization within functions that
inhibits and penalizes casual cooperation.  It is better to have 100 functions
operate on one data structure than to have 10 functions operate on 10 data
structures.&rdquo;</p>

In this book, we use <span id="index-list-1"></span>
<em>list</em> to mean a
chain of pairs terminated by the end-of-list marker.  In contrast, the term

just to lists.</p>

Since nested
applications of <code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code> are cumbersome to write, Lisp
dialects provide abbreviations for them&mdash;for instance,
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(cadr ⟨<var>arg</var>⟩) = (car (cdr ⟨<var>arg</var>⟩))
</pre></div>

<p>The names of all such procedures start with <code>c</code> and end with <code>r</code>.
Each <code>a</code> between them stands for a <code>car</code> operation and each <code>d</code>
for a <code>cdr</code> operation, to be applied in the same order in which they
appear in the name.  The names <code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code> persist because simple
combinations like <code>cadr</code> are pronounceable.</p>

<div id="FOOT76"><p><a class="footnote_backlink" href="#DOCF76"><sup>76</sup></a>
It&rsquo;s remarkable how much energy in the standardization of
Lisp dialects has been dissipated in arguments that are literally over nothing:
Should <code>nil</code> be an ordinary name?  Should the value of <code>nil</code> be a
symbol?  Should it be a list?  Should it be a pair?  In Scheme, <code>nil</code> is
an ordinary name, which we use in this section as a variable whose value is the
end-of-list marker (just as <code>true</code> is an ordinary variable that has a true
value).  Other dialects of Lisp, including Common Lisp, treat <code>nil</code> as a
special symbol.  The authors of this book, who have endured too many language
standardization brawls, would like to avoid the entire issue.  Once we have
introduced quotation in <a href="2_002e3.html#g_t2_002e3">2.3</a>, we will denote the empty list as
<code>'()</code> and dispense with the variable <code>nil</code> entirely.</p>

<span id="Footnote-78"></span>Scheme standardly provides a <code>map</code> procedure that
is more general than the one described here.  This more general <code>map</code>
takes a procedure of \( n \) arguments, together with \( n \) lists, and applies
the procedure to all the first elements of the lists, all the second elements
of the lists, and so on, returning a list of the results.  For example:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(map + 
     (list 1 2 3) 
     (list 40 50 60) 
     (list 700 800 900))
<i>(741 852 963)</i>

(map (lambda (x y) (+ x (* 2 y)))

Richard <a href="References.html#Waters-_00281979_0029">Waters (1979)</a> developed a
program that automatically analyzes traditional Fortran programs, viewing them
in terms of maps, filters, and accumulations.  He found that fully 90 percent
of the code in the Fortran Scientific Subroutine Package fits neatly into this
paradigm.  One of the reasons for the success of Lisp as a programming language
is that lists provide a standard medium for expressing ordered collections so
that they can be manipulated using higher-order operations.  The programming
language APL owes much of its power and appeal to a similar choice. In APL all
data are represented as arrays, and there is a universal and convenient set of
generic operators for all sorts of array operations.</p>

According to <a href="References.html#Knuth-1981">Knuth 1981</a>, this rule was formulated by
W. G. Horner early in the nineteenth century, but the method was actually used
by Newton over a hundred years earlier.  Horner&rsquo;s rule evaluates the polynomial
using fewer additions and multiplications than does the straightforward method
of first computing \( {a_n x^n} \), then adding
\( {a_{n-1}x^{n-1}} \), and so on.  In fact, it is possible to prove
that any algorithm for evaluating arbitrary polynomials must use at least as
many additions and multiplications as does Horner&rsquo;s rule, and thus Horner&rsquo;s
rule is an optimal algorithm for polynomial evaluation.  This was proved (for
the number of additions) by A. M. Ostrowski in a 1954 paper that essentially
founded the modern study of optimal algorithms.  The analogous statement for
multiplications was proved by V. Y. Pan in 1966.  The book by <a href="References.html#Borodin-and-Munro-_00281975_0029">Borodin and Munro (1975)</a>

algorithms.</p>

This approach to nested
mappings was shown to us by David Turner, whose languages KRC and Miranda
provide elegant formalisms for dealing with these constructs.  The examples in

William Barton Rogers (1804-1882) was the founder
and first president of <abbr>MIT</abbr>.  A geologist and talented teacher, he
taught at William and Mary College and at the University of Virginia.  In 1859
he moved to Boston, where he had more time for research, worked on a plan for
establishing a &ldquo;polytechnic institute,&rdquo; and served as Massachusetts&rsquo;s first
State Inspector of Gas Meters.
</p>
<p>When <abbr>MIT</abbr> was established in 1861, Rogers was elected its first
president.  Rogers espoused an ideal of &ldquo;useful learning&rdquo; that was different
from the university education of the time, with its overemphasis on the
classics, which, as he wrote, &ldquo;stand in the way of the broader, higher and
more practical instruction and discipline of the natural and social sciences.&rdquo;
This education was likewise to be different from narrow trade-school education.
In Rogers&rsquo;s words:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The world-enforced distinction between the practical and the scientific worker
is utterly futile, and the whole experience of modern times has demonstrated
its utter worthlessness.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Rogers served as president of <abbr>MIT</abbr> until 1870, when he resigned due to
ill health.  In 1878 the second president of <abbr>MIT</abbr>, John Runkle,
resigned under the pressure of a financial crisis brought on by the Panic of
1873 and strain of fighting off attempts by Harvard to take over <abbr>MIT</abbr>.
Rogers returned to hold the office of president until 1881.
</p>
<p>Rogers collapsed and died while addressing <abbr>MIT</abbr>&rsquo;s graduating class at
the commencement exercises of 1882.  Runkle quoted Rogers&rsquo;s last words in a
memorial address delivered that same year:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;As I stand here today and see what the Institute is, &hellip; I call to mind
the beginnings of science.  I remember one hundred and fifty years ago Stephen
Hales published a pamphlet on the subject of illuminating gas, in which he
stated that his researches had demonstrated that 128 grains of bituminous coal
&ndash; &rdquo; &ldquo;Bituminous coal,&rdquo; these were his last words on earth.  Here he bent
forward, as if consulting some notes on the table before him, then slowly
regaining an erect position, threw up his hands, and was translated from the
scene of his earthly labors and triumphs to &ldquo;the tomorrow of death,&rdquo; where
the mysteries of life are solved, and the disembodied spirit finds unending
satisfaction in contemplating the new and still unfathomable mysteries of the
infinite future.
</p></blockquote>

<p>In the words of Francis A. Walker (<abbr>MIT</abbr>&rsquo;s third president):
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All his life he had borne himself most faithfully and heroically, and he died
as so good a knight would surely have wished, in harness, at his post, and in
the very part and act of public duty.

For example, the <code>rogers</code> painter of <a href="#Figure-2_002e11">Figure 2.11</a> was
constructed from a gray-level image.  For each point in a given frame, the

under the frame coordinate map, and shades it accordingly.  By allowing
different types of painters, we are capitalizing on the abstract data idea

representation could be anything at all that satisfies an appropriate
