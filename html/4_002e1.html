<span id="The-Metacircular-Evaluator"></span><h3 class="section"><span class="secnum">4.1</span><span class="sectitle">The Metacircular Evaluator</span></h3>

<p>Our evaluator for Lisp will be implemented as a Lisp program.  It may seem
circular to think about evaluating Lisp programs using an evaluator that is
itself implemented in Lisp.  However, evaluation is a process, so it is
appropriate to describe the evaluation process using Lisp, which, after all, is
our tool for describing processes.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF207" href="#FOOT207"><sup>207</sup></a>
An evaluator that is written in the same language that it evaluates is said to
be <span id="index-metacircular"></span>
<em>metacircular</em>.
</p>
<p>The metacircular evaluator is essentially a Scheme formulation of the
environment model of evaluation described in <a href="3_002e2.html#g_t3_002e2">3.2</a>.  Recall that
the model has two basic parts:
</p>
<ol>
<li> To evaluate a combination (a compound expression other than a special form),
evaluate the subexpressions and then apply the value of the operator
subexpression to the values of the operand subexpressions.

</li><li> To apply a compound procedure to a set of arguments, evaluate the body of the
procedure in a new environment.  To construct this environment, extend the
environment part of the procedure object by a frame in which the formal
parameters of the procedure are bound to the arguments to which the procedure
is applied.

</li></ol>

<p>These two rules describe the essence of the evaluation process, a basic cycle
in which expressions to be evaluated in environments are reduced to procedures
to be applied to arguments, which in turn are reduced to new expressions to be
evaluated in new environments, and so on, until we get down to symbols, whose
values are looked up in the environment, and to primitive procedures, which are
applied directly (see <a href="#Figure-4_002e1">Figure 4.1</a>).<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF208" href="#FOOT208"><sup>208</sup></a> 
This evaluation cycle will be embodied by the interplay between the two
critical procedures in the evaluator, <code>eval</code> and <code>apply</code>, which are
described in <a href="#g_t4_002e1_002e1">4.1.1</a> (see <a href="#Figure-4_002e1">Figure 4.1</a>).
</p>

<div class="float-caption"><p><strong>Figure 4.1:</strong> The <code>eval</code>-<code>apply</code> cycle exposes the essence of a computer language.</p></div></div>
<p>The implementation of the evaluator will depend upon procedures that define the
<span id="index-syntax"></span>
<em>syntax</em> of the expressions to be evaluated.  We will use data
abstraction to make the evaluator independent of the representation of the
language.  For example, rather than committing to a choice that an assignment
is to be represented by a list beginning with the symbol <code>set!</code> we use an
abstract predicate <code>assignment?</code> to test for an assignment, and we use
abstract selectors <code>assignment-variable</code> and <code>assignment-value</code> to
access the parts of an assignment.  Implementation of expressions will be
described in detail in <a href="#g_t4_002e1_002e2">4.1.2</a>.  There are also operations,
described in <a href="#g_t4_002e1_002e3">4.1.3</a>, that specify the representation of procedures
and environments.  For example, <code>make-procedure</code> constructs compound
procedures, <code>lookup-variable-value</code> accesses the values of variables, and
<code>apply-primitive-procedure</code> applies a primitive procedure to a given list
of arguments.
</p>

<span id="g_t4_002e1_002e1"></span><span id="The-Core-of-the-Evaluator"></span><h4 class="subsection"><span class="secnum">4.1.1</span><span class="sectitle">The Core of the Evaluator</span></h4>

<p>The evaluation process can be described as the interplay between two
procedures: <code>eval</code> and <code>apply</code>.
</p>
<span id="Eval"></span><h4 class="subsubheading">Eval</h4>

<p><code>Eval</code> takes as arguments an expression and an environment.  It classifies
the expression and directs its evaluation.  <code>Eval</code> is structured as a case
analysis of the syntactic type of the expression to be evaluated.  In order to
keep the procedure general, we express the determination of the type of an
expression abstractly, making no commitment to any particular representation
for the various types of expressions.  Each type of expression has a predicate
that tests for it and an abstract means for selecting its parts.  This
<span id="index-abstract-syntax"></span>
<em>abstract syntax</em> makes it easy to see how we can change the syntax of
the language by using the same evaluator, but with a different collection of
syntax procedures.
</p>
<p><b>Primitive expressions</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li> For self-evaluating expressions, such as numbers, <code>eval</code> returns the
expression itself.

</li><li> <code>Eval</code> must look up variables in the environment to find their values.

</li></ul>

<p><b>Special forms</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li> For quoted expressions, <code>eval</code> returns the expression that was quoted.

</li><li> An assignment to (or a definition of) a variable must recursively call
<code>eval</code> to compute the new value to be associated with the variable.  The
environment must be modified to change (or create) the binding of the variable.

</li><li> An <code>if</code> expression requires special processing of its parts, so as to
evaluate the consequent if the predicate is true, and otherwise to evaluate the
alternative.

</li><li> A <code>lambda</code> expression must be transformed into an applicable procedure by
packaging together the parameters and body specified by the <code>lambda</code>
expression with the environment of the evaluation.

</li><li> A <code>begin</code> expression requires evaluating its sequence of expressions in
the order in which they appear.

</li><li> A case analysis (<code>cond</code>) is transformed into a nest of <code>if</code>
expressions and then evaluated.

</li></ul>

<p><b>Combinations</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li> For a procedure application, <code>eval</code> must recursively evaluate the operator
part and the operands of the combination.  The resulting procedure and
arguments are passed to <code>apply</code>, which handles the actual procedure
application.

</li></ul>

<p>Here is the definition of <code>eval</code>:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (eval exp env)
  (cond ((self-evaluating? exp) 
         exp)
        ((variable? exp) 
         (lookup-variable-value exp env))
        ((quoted? exp) 
         (text-of-quotation exp))
        ((assignment? exp) 
         (eval-assignment exp env))
        ((definition? exp) 
         (eval-definition exp env))
        ((if? exp) 
         (eval-if exp env))
        ((lambda? exp)
         (make-procedure 
          (lambda-parameters exp)
          (lambda-body exp)
          env))
        ((begin? exp)
         (eval-sequence 
          (begin-actions exp) 
          env))
        ((cond? exp) 
         (eval (cond-&gt;if exp) env))
        ((application? exp)
         (apply (eval (operator exp) env)
                (list-of-values 
                 (operands exp) 
                 env)))
        (else
         (error &quot;Unknown expression 
                 type: EVAL&quot; exp))))
</pre></div>

<p>For clarity, <code>eval</code> has been implemented as a case analysis using
<code>cond</code>.  The disadvantage of this is that our procedure handles only a few
distinguishable types of expressions, and no new ones can be defined without
editing the definition of <code>eval</code>.  In most Lisp implementations,
dispatching on the type of an expression is done in a data-directed style.
This allows a user to add new types of expressions that <code>eval</code> can
distinguish, without modifying the definition of <code>eval</code> itself.  (See
<a href="#Exercise-4_002e3">Exercise 4.3</a>.)
</p>
<span id="Apply"></span><h4 class="subsubheading">Apply</h4>

<p><code>Apply</code> takes two arguments, a procedure and a list of arguments to which
the procedure should be applied.  <code>Apply</code> classifies procedures into two
kinds: It calls <code>apply-primitive-procedure</code> to apply primitives; it
applies compound procedures by sequentially evaluating the expressions that
make up the body of the procedure.  The environment for the evaluation of the
body of a compound procedure is constructed by extending the base environment
carried by the procedure to include a frame that binds the parameters of the
procedure to the arguments to which the procedure is to be applied.  Here is
the definition of <code>apply</code>:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (apply procedure arguments)
  (cond ((primitive-procedure? procedure)
         (apply-primitive-procedure 
          procedure 
          arguments))
        ((compound-procedure? procedure)
         (eval-sequence
           (procedure-body procedure)
           (extend-environment
             (procedure-parameters 
              procedure)
             arguments
             (procedure-environment 
              procedure))))
        (else
         (error &quot;Unknown procedure 
                 type: APPLY&quot; 
                procedure))))
</pre></div>

<span id="Procedure-arguments"></span><h4 class="subsubheading">Procedure arguments</h4>

<p>When <code>eval</code> processes a procedure application, it uses
<code>list-of-values</code> to produce the list of arguments to which the procedure
is to be applied. <code>List-of-values</code> takes as an argument the operands of
the combination.  It evaluates each operand and returns a list of the
corresponding values:<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF209" href="#FOOT209"><sup>209</sup></a>
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (list-of-values exps env)
  (if (no-operands? exps)
      '()
      (cons (eval (first-operand exps) env)
            (list-of-values 
             (rest-operands exps) 
             env))))
</pre></div>

<span id="Conditionals"></span><h4 class="subsubheading">Conditionals</h4>

<p><code>Eval-if</code> evaluates the predicate part of an <code>if</code> expression in the
given environment.  If the result is true, <code>eval-if</code> evaluates the
consequent, otherwise it evaluates the alternative:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (eval-if exp env)
  (if (true? (eval (if-predicate exp) env))
      (eval (if-consequent exp) env)
      (eval (if-alternative exp) env)))
</pre></div>

<p>The use of <code>true?</code> in <code>eval-if</code> highlights the issue of the
connection between an implemented language and an implementation language.  The
<code>if-predicate</code> is evaluated in the language being implemented and thus
yields a value in that language.  The interpreter predicate <code>true?</code>
translates that value into a value that can be tested by the <code>if</code> in the
implementation language: The metacircular representation of truth might not be
the same as that of the underlying Scheme.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF210" href="#FOOT210"><sup>210</sup></a>
</p>
<span id="Sequences"></span><h4 class="subsubheading">Sequences</h4>

<p><code>Eval-sequence</code> is used by <code>apply</code> to evaluate the sequence of
expressions in a procedure body and by <code>eval</code> to evaluate the sequence of
expressions in a <code>begin</code> expression.  It takes as arguments a sequence of
expressions and an environment, and evaluates the expressions in the order in
which they occur.  The value returned is the value of the final expression.
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (eval-sequence exps env)
  (cond ((last-exp? exps) 
         (eval (first-exp exps) env))
        (else 
         (eval (first-exp exps) env)
         (eval-sequence (rest-exps exps) 
                        env))))
</pre></div>

<span id="Assignments-and-definitions"></span><h4 class="subsubheading">Assignments and definitions</h4>

<p>The following procedure handles assignments to variables.  It calls <code>eval</code>
to find the value to be assigned and transmits the variable and the resulting
value to <code>set-variable-value!</code> to be installed in the designated
environment.
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (eval-assignment exp env)
  (set-variable-value! 
   (assignment-variable exp)
   (eval (assignment-value exp) env)
   env)
  'ok)
</pre></div>

<p>Definitions of variables are handled in a similar manner.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF211" href="#FOOT211"><sup>211</sup></a>
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (eval-definition exp env)
  (define-variable! 
    (definition-variable exp)
    (eval (definition-value exp) env)
    env)
  'ok)
</pre></div>

<p>We have chosen here to return the symbol <code>ok</code> as the value of an
assignment or a definition.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF212" href="#FOOT212"><sup>212</sup></a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><span id="Exercise-4_002e1"></span>Exercise 4.1:</strong> Notice that we cannot tell whether
the metacircular evaluator evaluates operands from left to right or from right
to left.  Its evaluation order is inherited from the underlying Lisp: If the
arguments to <code>cons</code> in <code>list-of-values</code> are evaluated from left to
right, then <code>list-of-values</code> will evaluate operands from left to right;
and if the arguments to <code>cons</code> are evaluated from right to left, then
<code>list-of-values</code> will evaluate operands from right to left.
</p>
<p>Write a version of <code>list-of-values</code> that evaluates operands from left to
right regardless of the order of evaluation in the underlying Lisp.  Also write
a version of <code>list-of-values</code> that evaluates operands from right to left.

<span id="g_t4_002e1_002e2"></span><span id="Representing-Expressions"></span><h4 class="subsection"><span class="secnum">4.1.2</span><span class="sectitle">Representing Expressions</span></h4>

<p>The evaluator is reminiscent of the symbolic differentiation program discussed
in <a href="2_002e3.html#g_t2_002e3_002e2">2.3.2</a>.  Both programs operate on symbolic expressions.  In
both programs, the result of operating on a compound expression is determined
by operating recursively on the pieces of the expression and combining the
results in a way that depends on the type of the expression.  In both programs
we used data abstraction to decouple the general rules of operation from the
details of how expressions are represented.  In the differentiation program
this meant that the same differentiation procedure could deal with algebraic
expressions in prefix form, in infix form, or in some other form.  For the
evaluator, this means that the syntax of the language being evaluated is
determined solely by the procedures that classify and extract pieces of
expressions.
</p>
<p>Here is the specification of the syntax of our language:
</p>
<ul>
<li> The only self-evaluating items are numbers and strings:

<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (self-evaluating? exp)
  (cond ((number? exp) true)
        ((string? exp) true)
        (else false)))
</pre></div>

</li><li> Variables are represented by symbols:

<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (variable? exp) (symbol? exp))
</pre></div>

</li><li> Quotations have the form <code>(quote ⟨<var>text-of-quotation</var>⟩)</code>:<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF213" href="#FOOT213"><sup>213</sup></a>

<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (quoted? exp)
  (tagged-list? exp 'quote))

(define (text-of-quotation exp)
  (cadr exp))
</pre></div>

<p><code>Quoted?</code> is defined in terms of the procedure <code>tagged-list?</code>, which
identifies lists beginning with a designated symbol:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (tagged-list? exp tag)
  (if (pair? exp)
      (eq? (car exp) tag)
      false))
</pre></div>

</li><li> Assignments have the form <code>(set! ⟨<var>var</var>⟩ ⟨<var>value</var>⟩)</code>:

<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (assignment? exp)
  (tagged-list? exp 'set!))

(define (assignment-variable exp) 
  (cadr exp))

(define (assignment-value exp) (caddr exp))
</pre></div>

</li><li> Definitions have the form

<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define ⟨<var>var</var>⟩ ⟨<var>value</var>⟩)
</pre></div>

<p>or the form
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (⟨<var>var</var>⟩ ⟨<var>param₁</var>⟩ <span class="roman">…</span> ⟨<var>paramₙ</var>⟩)
  ⟨<var>body</var>⟩)
</pre></div>

<p>The latter form (standard procedure definition) is syntactic sugar for
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define ⟨<var>var</var>⟩
  (lambda (⟨<var>param₁</var>⟩ <span class="roman">…</span> ⟨<var>paramₙ</var>⟩)
    ⟨<var>body</var>⟩))
</pre></div>

<p>The corresponding syntax procedures are the following:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (definition? exp)
  (tagged-list? exp 'define))

(define (definition-variable exp)
  (if (symbol? (cadr exp))
      (cadr exp)
      (caadr exp)))

(define (definition-value exp)
  (if (symbol? (cadr exp))
      (caddr exp)
      (make-lambda 
       (cdadr exp)   <span class="roman">; formal parameters</span>
       (cddr exp)))) <span class="roman">; body</span>
</pre></div>

</li><li> <code>Lambda</code> expressions are lists that begin with the symbol <code>lambda</code>:

<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (lambda? exp) 
  (tagged-list? exp 'lambda))
(define (lambda-parameters exp) (cadr exp))
(define (lambda-body exp) (cddr exp))
</pre></div>

<p>We also provide a constructor for <code>lambda</code> expressions, which is used by
<code>definition-value</code>, above:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (make-lambda parameters body)
  (cons 'lambda (cons parameters body)))
</pre></div>

</li><li> Conditionals begin with <code>if</code> and have a predicate, a consequent, and an
(optional) alternative.  If the expression has no alternative part, we provide
<code>false</code> as the alternative.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF214" href="#FOOT214"><sup>214</sup></a>

<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (if? exp) (tagged-list? exp 'if))
(define (if-predicate exp) (cadr exp))
(define (if-consequent exp) (caddr exp))
(define (if-alternative exp)
  (if (not (null? (cdddr exp)))
      (cadddr exp)
      'false))
</pre></div>

<p>We also provide a constructor for <code>if</code> expressions, to be used by
<code>cond-&gt;if</code> to transform <code>cond</code> expressions into <code>if</code>
expressions:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (make-if predicate 
                 consequent 
                 alternative)
  (list 'if 
        predicate 
        consequent 
        alternative))
</pre></div>

</li><li> <code>Begin</code> packages a sequence of expressions into a single expression.  We
include syntax operations on <code>begin</code> expressions to extract the actual
sequence from the <code>begin</code> expression, as well as selectors that return the
first expression and the rest of the expressions in the
sequence.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF215" href="#FOOT215"><sup>215</sup></a>

<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (begin? exp) 
  (tagged-list? exp 'begin))
(define (begin-actions exp) (cdr exp))
(define (last-exp? seq) (null? (cdr seq)))
(define (first-exp seq) (car seq))
(define (rest-exps seq) (cdr seq))
</pre></div>

<p>We also include a constructor <code>sequence-&gt;exp</code> (for use by <code>cond-&gt;if</code>)
that transforms a sequence into a single expression, using <code>begin</code> if
necessary:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (sequence-&gt;exp seq)
  (cond ((null? seq) seq)
        ((last-exp? seq) (first-exp seq))
        (else (make-begin seq))))

(define (make-begin seq) (cons 'begin seq))
</pre></div>

</li><li> A procedure application is any compound expression that is not one of the above
expression types.  The <code>car</code> of the expression is the operator, and the
<code>cdr</code> is the list of operands:

<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (application? exp) (pair? exp))
(define (operator exp) (car exp))
(define (operands exp) (cdr exp))
(define (no-operands? ops) (null? ops))
(define (first-operand ops) (car ops))
(define (rest-operands ops) (cdr ops))
</pre></div>

</li></ul>

<span id="Derived-expressions"></span><h4 class="subsubheading">Derived expressions</h4>

<p>Some special forms in our language can be defined in terms of expressions
involving other special forms, rather than being implemented directly.  One
example is <code>cond</code>, which can be implemented as a nest of <code>if</code>
expressions.  For example, we can reduce the problem of evaluating the
expression
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(cond ((&gt; x 0) x)
      ((= x 0) (display 'zero) 0)
      (else (- x)))
</pre></div>

<p>to the problem of evaluating the following expression involving <code>if</code> and
<code>begin</code> expressions:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(if (&gt; x 0)
    x
    (if (= x 0)
        (begin (display 'zero) 0)
        (- x)))
</pre></div>

<p>Implementing the evaluation of <code>cond</code> in this way simplifies the evaluator
because it reduces the number of special forms for which the evaluation process
must be explicitly specified.

<p><strong><span id="Exercise-4_002e2"></span>Exercise 4.2:</strong> Louis Reasoner plans to reorder the
<code>cond</code> clauses in <code>eval</code> so that the clause for procedure
applications appears before the clause for assignments.  He argues that this
will make the interpreter more efficient: Since programs usually contain more
applications than assignments, definitions, and so on, his modified <code>eval</code>
will usually check fewer clauses than the original <code>eval</code> before
identifying the type of an expression.
</p>
<ol type="a" start="1">
<li> What is wrong with Louis&rsquo;s plan?  (Hint: What will Louis&rsquo;s evaluator do with
the expression <code>(define x 3)</code>?)

</li><li> Louis is upset that his plan didn&rsquo;t work.  He is willing to go to any lengths
to make his evaluator recognize procedure applications before it checks for
most other kinds of expressions.  Help him by changing the syntax of the
evaluated language so that procedure applications start with <code>call</code>.  For
example, instead of <code>(factorial 3)</code> we will now have to write <code>(call
factorial 3)</code> and instead of <code>(+ 1 2)</code> we will have to write <code>(call +
1 2)</code>.

<p>These mechanisms for handling primitives are further described in 
<a href="#g_t4_002e1_002e4">4.1.4</a>.

<span id="Operations-on-Environments"></span><h4 class="subsubheading">Operations on Environments</h4>

<p>The evaluator needs operations for manipulating environments.  As explained in
<a href="3_002e2.html#g_t3_002e2">3.2</a>, an environment is a sequence of frames, where each frame is
a table of bindings that associate variables with their corresponding values.
We use the following operations for manipulating environments:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <code>(lookup-variable-value ⟨<var>var</var>⟩ ⟨<var>env</var>⟩)</code>

<p>returns the value that is bound to the symbol <code>⟨</code><var>var</var><code>⟩</code> in the environment
<code>⟨</code><var>env</var><code>⟩</code>, or signals an error if the variable is unbound.
</p>
</li><li> <code>(extend-environment ⟨<var>variables</var>⟩ ⟨<var>values</var>⟩ ⟨<var>base-env</var>⟩)</code>

<p>returns a new environment, consisting of a new frame in which the symbols in
the list <code>⟨</code><var>variables</var><code>⟩</code> are bound to the corresponding elements in the list
<code>⟨</code><var>values</var><code>⟩</code>, where the enclosing environment is the environment
<code>⟨</code><var>base-env</var><code>⟩</code>.
</p>
</li><li> <code>(define-variable! ⟨<var>var</var>⟩ ⟨<var>value</var>⟩ ⟨<var>env</var>⟩)</code>

<p>adds to the first frame in the environment <code>⟨</code><var>env</var><code>⟩</code> a new binding that
associates the variable <code>⟨</code><var>var</var><code>⟩</code> with the value <code>⟨</code><var>value</var><code>⟩</code>.
</p>
</li><li> <code>(set-variable-value! ⟨<var>var</var>⟩ ⟨<var>value</var>⟩ ⟨<var>env</var>⟩)</code>

<p>changes the binding of the variable <code>⟨</code><var>var</var><code>⟩</code> in the environment <code>⟨</code><var>env</var><code>⟩</code>
so that the variable is now bound to the value <code>⟨</code><var>value</var><code>⟩</code>, or signals an
error if the variable is unbound.
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>To implement these operations we represent an environment as a list of frames.
The enclosing environment of an environment is the <code>cdr</code> of the list.  The
empty environment is simply the empty list.
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (enclosing-environment env) (cdr env))
(define (first-frame env) (car env))
(define the-empty-environment '())
</pre></div>

<p>Each frame of an environment is represented as a pair of lists: a list of the
variables bound in that frame and a list of the associated
values.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF218" href="#FOOT218"><sup>218</sup></a>
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (make-frame variables values)
  (cons variables values))
(define (frame-variables frame) (car frame))

(define (add-binding-to-frame! var val frame)
  (set-car! frame (cons var (car frame)))
  (set-cdr! frame (cons val (cdr frame))))
</pre></div>

<p>To extend an environment by a new frame that associates variables with values,
we make a frame consisting of the list of variables and the list of values, and
we adjoin this to the environment.  We signal an error if the number of
variables does not match the number of values.
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (extend-environment vars vals base-env)
  (if (= (length vars) (length vals))
      (cons (make-frame vars vals) base-env)
      (if (&lt; (length vars) (length vals))
          (error &quot;Too many arguments supplied&quot; 
                 vars 
                 vals)
          (error &quot;Too few arguments supplied&quot; 
                 vars 
                 vals))))
</pre></div>

<p>To look up a variable in an environment, we scan the list of variables in the
first frame.  If we find the desired variable, we return the corresponding
element in the list of values.  If we do not find the variable in the current
frame, we search the enclosing environment, and so on.  If we reach the empty
environment, we signal an &ldquo;unbound variable&rdquo; error.
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (lookup-variable-value var env)
  (define (env-loop env)
    (define (scan vars vals)

  (env-loop env))

<p>To set a variable to a new value in a specified environment, we scan for the

  (env-loop env))
</pre></div>

<p>To define a variable, we search the first frame for a binding for the variable,
and change the binding if it exists (just as in <code>set-variable-value!</code>).
If no such binding exists, we adjoin one to the first frame.
</p>
<div class="lisp">

<p>The method described here is only one of many plausible ways to represent
environments.  Since we used data abstraction to isolate the rest of the
evaluator from the detailed choice of representation, we could change the
environment representation if we wanted to.  (See <a href="#Exercise-4_002e11">Exercise 4.11</a>.)  In a
production-quality Lisp system, the speed of the evaluator&rsquo;s environment
operations&mdash;especially that of variable lookup&mdash;has a major impact on the
performance of the system.  The representation described here, although
conceptually simple, is not efficient and would not ordinarily be used in a
production system.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF219" href="#FOOT219"><sup>219</sup></a>

<p>Given the evaluator, we have in our hands a description (expressed in Lisp) of
the process by which Lisp expressions are evaluated.  One advantage of
expressing the evaluator as a program is that we can run the program.  This
gives us, running within Lisp, a working model of how Lisp itself evaluates
expressions.  This can serve as a framework for experimenting with evaluation
rules, as we shall do later in this chapter.
</p>
<p>Our evaluator program reduces expressions ultimately to the application of
primitive procedures.  Therefore, all that we need to run the evaluator is to
create a mechanism that calls on the underlying Lisp system to model the
application of primitive procedures.
</p>
<p>There must be a binding for each primitive procedure name, so that when
<code>eval</code> evaluates the operator of an application of a primitive, it will
find an object to pass to <code>apply</code>.  We thus set up a global environment
that associates unique objects with the names of the primitive procedures that
can appear in the expressions we will be evaluating.  The global environment
also includes bindings for the symbols <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>, so that
they can be used as variables in expressions to be evaluated.
</p>

<p>It does not matter how we represent the primitive procedure objects, so long as

<code>primitive</code> and containing a procedure in the underlying Lisp that
implements that primitive.

<p>In thinking about a Lisp program that evaluates Lisp expressions, an analogy
might be helpful.  One operational view of the meaning of a program is that a
program is a description of an abstract (perhaps infinitely large) machine.
For example, consider the familiar program to compute factorials:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (factorial n)
  (if (= n 1)
      1
      (* (factorial (- n 1)) n)))
</pre></div>

<p>We may regard this program as the description of a machine containing parts
that decrement, multiply, and test for equality, together with a two-position
switch and another factorial machine. (The factorial machine is infinite
because it contains another factorial machine within it.)  <a href="#Figure-4_002e2">Figure 4.2</a> is
a flow diagram for the factorial machine, showing how the parts are wired
together.
</p>
<div class="float">
<span id="Figure-4_002e2"></span><img src="fig/chap4/Fig4.2a.std.svg" alt="fig/chap4/Fig4.2a">

<div class="float-caption"><p><strong>Figure 4.2:</strong> The factorial program, viewed as an abstract machine.</p></div></div>
<p>In a similar way, we can regard the evaluator as a very special machine that
takes as input a description of a machine.  Given this input, the evaluator
configures itself to emulate the machine described.  For example, if we feed
our evaluator the definition of <code>factorial</code>, as shown in <a href="#Figure-4_002e3">Figure 4.3</a>,
the evaluator will be able to compute factorials.
</p>
<div class="float">
<span id="Figure-4_002e3"></span><img src="fig/chap4/Fig4.3.std.svg" alt="fig/chap4/Fig4.3">

<div class="float-caption"><p><strong>Figure 4.3:</strong> The evaluator emulating a factorial machine.</p></div></div>
<p>From this perspective, our evaluator is seen to be a <span id="index-universal-machine"></span>
<em>universal machine</em>.  
It mimics other machines when these are described as Lisp
programs.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF223" href="#FOOT223"><sup>223</sup></a> This is striking. Try to imagine an analogous evaluator
for electrical circuits.  This would be a circuit that takes as input a signal
encoding the plans for some other circuit, such as a filter.  Given this input,
the circuit evaluator would then behave like a filter with the same
description.  Such a universal electrical circuit is almost unimaginably
complex.  It is remarkable that the program evaluator is a rather simple
program.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF224" href="#FOOT224"><sup>224</sup></a>
</p>
<p>Another striking aspect of the evaluator is that it acts as a bridge between
the data objects that are manipulated by our programming language and the
programming language itself.  Imagine that the evaluator program (implemented
in Lisp) is running, and that a user is typing expressions to the evaluator and
observing the results.  From the perspective of the user, an input expression
such as <code>(* x x)</code> is an expression in the programming language, which the
evaluator should execute.  From the perspective of the evaluator, however, the
expression is simply a list (in this case, a list of three symbols: <code>*</code>,
<code>x</code>, and <code>x</code>) that is to be manipulated according to a well-defined
set of rules.
</p>
<p>That the user&rsquo;s programs are the evaluator&rsquo;s data need not be a source of
confusion.  In fact, it is sometimes convenient to ignore this distinction, and
to give the user the ability to explicitly evaluate a data object as a Lisp
expression, by making <code>eval</code> available for use in programs.  Many Lisp
dialects provide a primitive <code>eval</code> procedure that takes as arguments an
expression and an environment and evaluates the expression relative to the
environment.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF225" href="#FOOT225"><sup>225</sup></a> Thus,
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(eval '(* 5 5) user-initial-environment)

<p>and
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(eval (cons '* (list 5 5)) 
      user-initial-environment)
</pre></div>

<p>will both return 25.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF226" href="#FOOT226"><sup>226</sup></a>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><span id="Exercise-4_002e15"></span>Exercise 4.15:</strong> Given a one-argument procedure
<code>p</code> and an object <code>a</code>, <code>p</code> is said to &ldquo;halt&rdquo; on <code>a</code> if
evaluating the expression <code>(p a)</code> returns a value (as opposed to
terminating with an error message or running forever).  Show that it is
impossible to write a procedure <code>halts?</code> that correctly determines whether
<code>p</code> halts on <code>a</code> for any procedure <code>p</code> and object <code>a</code>.  Use
the following reasoning: If you had such a procedure <code>halts?</code>, you could
implement the following program:

<p>Our environment model of evaluation and our metacircular evaluator execute
definitions in sequence, extending the environment frame one definition at a
time.  This is particularly convenient for interactive program development, in
which the programmer needs to freely mix the application of procedures with the
definition of new procedures.  However, if we think carefully about the
internal definitions used to implement block structure (introduced in 
<a href="1_002e1.html#g_t1_002e1_002e8">1.1.8</a>), we will find that name-by-name extension of the environment may
not be the best way to define local variables.
</p>
<p>Consider a procedure with internal definitions, such as
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (f x)
  (define (even? n)
    (if (= n 0)
        true
        (odd? (- n 1))))
  (define (odd? n)
    (if (= n 0)
        false
        (even? (- n 1))))
  ⟨<var>rest of body of <code>f</code></var>⟩)
</pre></div>

<p>Our intention here is that the name <code>odd?</code> in the body of the procedure
<code>even?</code> should refer to the procedure <code>odd?</code> that is defined after
<code>even?</code>.  The scope of the name <code>odd?</code> is the entire body of
<code>f</code>, not just the portion of the body of <code>f</code> starting at the point
where the <code>define</code> for <code>odd?</code> occurs.  Indeed, when we consider that
<code>odd?</code> is itself defined in terms of <code>even?</code>&mdash;so that <code>even?</code>
and <code>odd?</code> are mutually recursive procedures&mdash;we see that the only
satisfactory interpretation of the two <code>define</code>s is to regard them as if
the names <code>even?</code> and <code>odd?</code> were being added to the environment
simultaneously.  More generally, in block structure, the scope of a local name
is the entire procedure body in which the <code>define</code> is evaluated.
</p>
<p>As it happens, our interpreter will evaluate calls to <code>f</code> correctly, but
for an &ldquo;accidental&rdquo; reason: Since the definitions of the internal procedures
come first, no calls to these procedures will be evaluated until all of them
have been defined.  Hence, <code>odd?</code>  will have been defined by the time
<code>even?</code> is executed.  In fact, our sequential evaluation mechanism will
give the same result as a mechanism that directly implements simultaneous
definition for any procedure in which the internal definitions come first in a
body and evaluation of the value expressions for the defined variables doesn&rsquo;t
actually use any of the defined variables.  (For an example of a procedure that
doesn&rsquo;t obey these restrictions, so that sequential definition isn&rsquo;t equivalent
to simultaneous definition, see <a href="#Exercise-4_002e19">Exercise 4.19</a>.)<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF228" href="#FOOT228"><sup>228</sup></a>
</p>
<p>There is, however, a simple way to treat definitions so that internally defined
names have truly simultaneous scope&mdash;just create all local variables that will
be in the current environment before evaluating any of the value expressions.
One way to do this is by a syntax transformation on <code>lambda</code> expressions.
Before evaluating the body of a <code>lambda</code> expression, we &ldquo;scan out&rdquo; and
eliminate all the internal definitions in the body.  The internally defined
variables will be created with a <code>let</code> and then set to their values by
assignment.  For example, the procedure
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(lambda ⟨<var>vars</var>⟩
  (define u ⟨<var>e1</var>⟩)
  (define v ⟨<var>e2</var>⟩)
  ⟨<var>e3</var>⟩)
</pre></div>

<p>would be transformed into
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(lambda ⟨<var>vars</var>⟩
  (let ((u '*unassigned*)
        (v '*unassigned*))
    (set! u ⟨<var>e1</var>⟩)
    (set! v ⟨<var>e2</var>⟩)
    ⟨<var>e3</var>⟩))
</pre></div>

<p>where <code>*unassigned*</code> is a special symbol that causes looking up a variable
to signal an error if an attempt is made to use the value of the
not-yet-assigned variable.
</p>
<p>An alternative strategy for scanning out internal definitions is shown in
<a href="#Exercise-4_002e18">Exercise 4.18</a>.  Unlike the transformation shown above, this enforces the
restriction that the defined variables&rsquo; values can be evaluated without using
any of the variables&rsquo; values.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF229" href="#FOOT229"><sup>229</sup></a>

unreasonable to treat procedure names differently from other names.  Thus, she

are truly meant to be simultaneous, then the value 5 for <code>a</code> should be

<p>The evaluator implemented above is simple, but it is very inefficient, because
the syntactic analysis of expressions is interleaved with their execution.
Thus if a program is executed many times, its syntax is analyzed many times.
Consider, for example, evaluating <code>(factorial 4)</code> using the following
definition of <code>factorial</code>:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (factorial n)
  (if (= n 1)
      1
      (* (factorial (- n 1)) n)))
</pre></div>

<p>Each time <code>factorial</code> is called, the evaluator must determine that the
body is an <code>if</code> expression and extract the predicate.  Only then can it
evaluate the predicate and dispatch on its value.  Each time it evaluates the
expression <code>(* (factorial (- n 1)) n)</code>, or the subexpressions
<code>(factorial (- n 1))</code> and <code>(- n 1)</code>, the evaluator must perform the
case analysis in <code>eval</code> to determine that the expression is an
application, and must extract its operator and operands.  This analysis is
expensive.  Performing it repeatedly is wasteful.
</p>
<p>We can transform the evaluator to be significantly more efficient by arranging
things so that syntactic analysis is performed only once.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF232" href="#FOOT232"><sup>232</sup></a> We split <code>eval</code>, which takes an expression and an

<em>execution procedure</em>, that encapsulates the work to be done in
executing the analyzed expression.  The execution procedure takes an
environment as its argument and completes the evaluation.  This saves work
because <code>analyze</code> will be called only once on an expression, while the
execution procedure may be called many times.

<p>Here is the simplest syntactic analysis procedure, which handles
self-evaluating expressions.  It returns an execution procedure that ignores
its environment argument and just returns the expression:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (analyze-self-evaluating exp)
  (lambda (env) exp))
</pre></div>

<p>For a quoted expression, we can gain a little efficiency by extracting the text
of the quotation only once, in the analysis phase, rather than in the execution
phase.

<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (analyze-quoted exp)
  (let ((qval (text-of-quotation exp)))

<p>Looking up a variable value must still be done in the execution phase, since
this depends upon knowing the environment.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF233" href="#FOOT233"><sup>233</sup></a>

<pre class="lisp">(define (analyze-variable exp)
  (lambda (env) 
    (lookup-variable-value exp env)))

<p><code>Analyze-assignment</code> also must defer actually setting the variable until
the execution, when the environment has been supplied.  However, the fact that
the <code>assignment-value</code> expression can be analyzed (recursively) during
analysis is a major gain in efficiency, because the <code>assignment-value</code>
expression will now be analyzed only once.  The same holds true for
definitions.

<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (analyze-assignment exp)

<p>For <code>if</code> expressions, we extract and analyze the predicate, consequent,
and alternative at analysis time.

<p>Analyzing a <code>lambda</code> expression also achieves a major gain in efficiency:
We analyze the <code>lambda</code> body only once, even though procedures resulting
from evaluation of the <code>lambda</code> may be applied many times.

<p>Analysis of a sequence of expressions (as in a <code>begin</code> or the body of a
<code>lambda</code> expression) is more involved.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF234" href="#FOOT234"><sup>234</sup></a> Each expression in the

Even so, there will remain
important aspects of the evaluation process that are not elucidated by our
evaluator.  The most important of these are the detailed mechanisms by which
procedures call other procedures and return values to their callers.  We will
address these issues in <a href="Chapter-5.html">Chapter 5</a>, where we take a closer look at the
evaluation process by implementing the evaluator as a simple register machine.</p>

<div id="FOOT208"><p><a class="footnote_backlink" href="#DOCF208"><sup>208</sup></a>
If we grant ourselves the
ability to apply primitives, then what remains for us to implement in the
evaluator?  The job of the evaluator is not to specify the primitives of the
language, but rather to provide the connective tissue&mdash;the means of
combination and the means of abstraction&mdash;that binds a collection of
primitives to form a language. Specifically:
</p>
<ul>
<li> The evaluator enables us to deal with nested expressions.  For example,
although simply applying primitives would suffice for evaluating the expression
<code>(+ 1 6)</code>, it is not adequate for handling <code>(+ 1 (* 2 3))</code>.  As far
as the primitive procedure <code>+</code> is concerned, its arguments must be
numbers, and it would choke if we passed it the expression <code>(* 2 3)</code> as an
argument.  One important role of the evaluator is to choreograph procedure
composition so that <code>(* 2 3)</code> is reduced to 6 before being passed as an
argument to <code>+</code>.

</li><li> The evaluator allows us to use variables.  For example, the primitive procedure
for addition has no way to deal with expressions such as <code>(+ x 1)</code>.  We
need an evaluator to keep track of variables and obtain their values before
invoking the primitive procedures.

</li><li> The evaluator allows us to define compound procedures.  This involves keeping
track of procedure definitions, knowing how to use these definitions in
evaluating expressions, and providing a mechanism that enables procedures to
accept arguments.

</li><li> The evaluator provides the special forms, which must be evaluated differently
from procedure calls.

</li></ul>
</div>
<div id="FOOT209"><p><a class="footnote_backlink" href="#DOCF209"><sup>209</sup></a>
We could have simplified the <code>application?</code>
clause in <code>eval</code> by using <code>map</code> (and stipulating that <code>operands</code>
returns a list) rather than writing an explicit <code>list-of-values</code>
procedure.  We chose not to use <code>map</code> here to emphasize the fact that the
evaluator can be implemented without any use of higher-order procedures (and
thus could be written in a language that doesn&rsquo;t have higher-order procedures),
even though the language that it supports will include higher-order
procedures.</p>
</div>
<div id="FOOT210"><p><a class="footnote_backlink" href="#DOCF210"><sup>210</sup></a>

As
mentioned in <a href="2_002e3.html#g_t2_002e3_002e1">2.3.1</a>, the evaluator sees a quoted expression as a
list beginning with <code>quote</code>, even if the expression is typed with the
quotation mark.  For example, the expression <code>'a</code> would be seen by the
evaluator as <code>(quote a)</code>.  See <a href="2_002e3.html#Exercise-2_002e55">Exercise 2.55</a>.</p>

The value of an <code>if</code> expression

Practical Lisp systems provide a mechanism that allows a user
to add new derived expressions and specify their implementation as syntactic
transformations without modifying the evaluator.  Such a user-defined
transformation is called a <span id="index-macro"></span>
<em>macro</em>.  Although it is easy to add an
elementary mechanism for defining macros, the resulting language has subtle
name-conflict problems.  There has been much research on mechanisms for macro
definition that do not cause these difficulties.  See, for example, <a href="References.html#Kohlbecker-1986">Kohlbecker 1986</a>,

Frames are not really a data abstraction in the following
code: <code>Set-variable-value!</code> and <code>define-variable!</code> use

frame procedures is to make the environment-manipulation procedures easy to
read.</p>

<div id="FOOT219"><p><a class="footnote_backlink" href="#DOCF219"><sup>219</sup></a>
The drawback of this representation (as well as the
variant in <a href="#Exercise-4_002e11">Exercise 4.11</a>) is that the evaluator may have to search
through many frames in order to find the binding for a given variable.  (Such
an approach is referred to as <span id="index-deep-binding"></span>
<em>deep binding</em>.)  One way to avoid this
inefficiency is to make use of a strategy called <span id="index-lexical-addressing"></span>

Any procedure defined in the underlying Lisp
can be used as a primitive for the metacircular evaluator.  The name of a
primitive installed in the evaluator need not be the same as the name of its
implementation in the underlying Lisp; the names are the same here because the
metacircular evaluator implements Scheme itself.  Thus, for example, we could
put <code>(list 'first car)</code> or <code>(list 'square (lambda (x) (* x x)))</code> in
the list of <code>primitive-procedures</code>.</p>

<code>Apply-in-underlying-scheme</code> is the <code>apply</code>
procedure we have used in earlier chapters.  The metacircular evaluator&rsquo;s
<code>apply</code> procedure (<a href="#g_t4_002e1_002e1">4.1.1</a>) models the working of this
primitive.  Having two different things called <code>apply</code> leads to a
technical problem in running the metacircular evaluator, because defining the
metacircular evaluator&rsquo;s <code>apply</code> will mask the definition of the
primitive.  One way around this is to rename the metacircular <code>apply</code> to
avoid conflict with the name of the primitive procedure.  We have assumed
instead that we have saved a reference to the underlying <code>apply</code> by doing

The
primitive procedure <code>read</code> waits for input from the user, and returns the
next complete expression that is typed.  For example, if the user types
<code>(+ 23 x)</code>, <code>read</code> returns a three-element list containing the symbol
<code>+</code>, the number 23, and the symbol <code>x</code>.  If the user types <code>'x</code>,
<code>read</code> returns a two-element list containing the symbol <code>quote</code> and

The fact that the machines are described in Lisp is
inessential.  If we give our evaluator a Lisp program that behaves as an
evaluator for some other language, say C, the Lisp evaluator will emulate the C
evaluator, which in turn can emulate any machine described as a C program.
Similarly, writing a Lisp evaluator in C produces a C program that can execute
any Lisp program.  The deep idea here is that any evaluator can emulate any
other.  Thus, the notion of &ldquo;what can in principle be computed&rdquo; (ignoring
practicalities of time and memory required) is independent of the language or
the computer, and instead reflects an underlying notion of
<span id="index-computability"></span>
<em>computability</em>.  This was first demonstrated in a clear way by Alan
M. Turing (1912-1954), whose 1936 paper laid the foundations for theoretical
computer science.  In the paper, Turing presented a simple computational
model&mdash;now known as a <span id="index-Turing-machine"></span>
<em>Turing machine</em>&mdash;and argued that any
&ldquo;effective process&rdquo; can be formulated as a program for such a machine.  (This
argument is known as the <span id="index-Church_002dTuring-thesis"></span>
<em>Church-Turing thesis</em>.)  Turing then
implemented a universal machine, i.e., a Turing machine that behaves as an
evaluator for Turing-machine programs.  He used this framework to demonstrate
that there are well-posed problems that cannot be computed by Turing machines
(see <a href="#Exercise-4_002e15">Exercise 4.15</a>), and so by implication cannot be formulated as
&ldquo;effective processes.&rdquo;  Turing went on to make fundamental contributions to
practical computer science as well.  For example, he invented the idea of
structuring programs using general-purpose subroutines.  See <a href="References.html#Hodges-1983">Hodges 1983</a> for a
biography of Turing.</p>

Some people find it counterintuitive that an evaluator, which
is implemented by a relatively simple procedure, can emulate programs that are
more complex than the evaluator itself.  The existence of a universal evaluator
machine is a deep and wonderful property of computation.  <span id="index-Recursion-theory"></span>
<em>Recursion theory</em>,
