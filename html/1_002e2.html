<p>We have now considered the elements of programming: We have used primitive
arithmetic operations, we have combined these operations, and we have
abstracted these composite operations by defining them as compound procedures.
But that is not enough to enable us to say that we know how to program.  Our
situation is analogous to that of someone who has learned the rules for how the
pieces move in chess but knows nothing of typical openings, tactics, or
strategy.  Like the novice chess player, we don&rsquo;t yet know the common patterns
of usage in the domain.  We lack the knowledge of which moves are worth making
(which procedures are worth defining).  We lack the experience to predict the
consequences of making a move (executing a procedure).
</p>
<p>The ability to visualize the consequences of the actions under consideration is
crucial to becoming an expert programmer, just as it is in any synthetic,
creative activity.  In becoming an expert photographer, for example, one must
learn how to look at a scene and know how dark each region will appear on a
print for each possible choice of exposure and development conditions.  Only
then can one reason backward, planning framing, lighting, exposure, and
development to obtain the desired effects.  So it is with programming, where we
are planning the course of action to be taken by a process and where we control
the process by means of a program.  To become experts, we must learn to
visualize the processes generated by various types of procedures.  Only after
we have developed such a skill can we learn to reliably construct programs that
exhibit the desired behavior.
</p>
<p>A procedure is a pattern for the <span id="index-local-evolution"></span>
<em>local evolution</em> of a computational
process.  It specifies how each stage of the process is built upon the previous
stage.  We would like to be able to make statements about the overall, or
<span id="index-global"></span>
<em>global</em>, behavior of a process whose local evolution has been
specified by a procedure.  This is very difficult to do in general, but we can
at least try to describe some typical patterns of process evolution.
</p>
<p>In this section we will examine some common &ldquo;shapes&rdquo; for processes generated
by simple procedures.  We will also investigate the rates at which these
processes consume the important computational resources of time and space.  The
procedures we will consider are very simple.  Their role is like that played by
test patterns in photography: as oversimplified prototypical patterns, rather
than practical examples in their own right.

<span id="g_t1_002e2_002e1"></span><span id="Linear-Recursion-and-Iteration"></span><h4 class="subsection"><span class="secnum">1.2.1</span><span class="sectitle">Linear Recursion and Iteration</span></h4>

<p>We begin by considering the factorial function, defined by

\[ % :5:
 
n! \,=\, {n \cdot (n - 1)} \cdot {(n - 2)} \cdots {3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1.}
\]

There are many ways to compute factorials.  One way is to make use of the
observation that \( {n!} \) is equal to \( n \) times \( {(n - 1)!} \) for any positive
integer \( n \):

\[ % :6:
 
n! \,=\, {n \cdot [(n - 1)} \cdot {(n - 2)} \cdots {3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1]} \,=\, {n \cdot (n - 1)!.}
\]

Thus, we can compute \( {n!} \) by computing \( {(n - 1)!} \) and multiplying the
result by \( n \).  If we add the stipulation that 1! is equal to 1, this
observation translates directly into a procedure:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (factorial n)
  (if (= n 1) 
      1 
      (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
</pre></div>

<p>We can use the substitution model of <a href="1_002e1.html#g_t1_002e1_002e5">1.1.5</a> to watch this
procedure in action computing 6!, as shown in <a href="#Figure-1_002e3">Figure 1.3</a>.
</p>
<div class="float">
<span id="Figure-1_002e3"></span><img src="fig/chap1/Fig1.3d.std.svg" alt="fig/chap1/Fig1.3d">

<div class="float-caption"><p><strong>Figure 1.3:</strong> A linear recursive process for computing 6!.</p></div></div>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s take a different perspective on computing factorials.  We could
describe a rule for computing \( {n!} \) by specifying that we first multiply 1 by
2, then multiply the result by 3, then by 4, and so on until we reach \( n \).
More formally, we maintain a running product, together with a counter that
counts from 1 up to \( n \).  We can describe the computation by saying that the
counter and the product simultaneously change from one step to the next
according to the rule
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">product \( \gets \) counter * product
counter \( \gets \) counter + 1
</pre></div>

<p>and stipulating that \( {n!} \) is the value of the product when the counter
exceeds \( n \).
</p>
<p>Once again, we can recast our description as a procedure for computing
factorials:<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF29" href="#FOOT29"><sup>29</sup></a>
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (factorial n) 
  (fact-iter 1 1 n))

(define (fact-iter product counter max-count)
  (if (&gt; counter max-count)
      product
      (fact-iter (* counter product)
                 (+ counter 1)
                 max-count)))
</pre></div>

<p>As before, we can use the substitution model to visualize the process of
computing 6!, as shown in <a href="#Figure-1_002e4">Figure 1.4</a>.
</p>
<div class="float">
<span id="Figure-1_002e4"></span><img src="fig/chap1/Fig1.4d.std.svg" alt="fig/chap1/Fig1.4d">

<div class="float-caption"><p><strong>Figure 1.4:</strong> A linear iterative process for computing 6!.</p></div></div>
<p>Compare the two processes.  From one point of view, they seem hardly different
at all.  Both compute the same mathematical function on the same domain, and
each requires a number of steps proportional to \( n \) to compute \( {n!} \).
Indeed, both processes even carry out the same sequence of multiplications,
obtaining the same sequence of partial products.  On the other hand, when we
consider the &ldquo;shapes&rdquo; of the two processes, we find that they evolve quite
differently.
</p>
<p>Consider the first process.  The substitution model reveals a shape of
expansion followed by contraction, indicated by the arrow in <a href="#Figure-1_002e3">Figure 1.3</a>.
The expansion occurs as the process builds up a chain of <span id="index-deferred-operations"></span>
<em>deferred operations</em> 
(in this case, a chain of multiplications).  The contraction occurs
as the operations are actually performed.  This type of process, characterized
by a chain of deferred operations, is called a <span id="index-recursive-process"></span>
<em>recursive process</em>.
Carrying out this process requires that the interpreter keep track of the
operations to be performed later on.  In the computation of \( {n!} \), the length
of the chain of deferred multiplications, and hence the amount of information
needed to keep track of it, grows linearly with \( n \) (is proportional to
\( n \)), just like the number of steps.  Such a process is called a
<span id="index-linear-recursive-process"></span>
<em>linear recursive process</em>.
</p>
<p>By contrast, the second process does not grow and shrink.  At each step, all we
need to keep track of, for any \( n \), are the current values of the variables
<code>product</code>, <code>counter</code>, and <code>max-count</code>.  We call this an
<span id="index-iterative-process"></span>
<em>iterative process</em>.  In general, an iterative process is one whose
state can be summarized by a fixed number of <span id="index-state-variables"></span>
<em>state variables</em>,
together with a fixed rule that describes how the state variables should be
updated as the process moves from state to state and an (optional) end test
that specifies conditions under which the process should terminate.  In
computing \( {n!} \), the number of steps required grows linearly with \( n \).  Such
a process is called a <span id="index-linear-iterative-process"></span>
<em>linear iterative process</em>.
</p>
<p>The contrast between the two processes can be seen in another way.  In the
iterative case, the program variables provide a complete description of the
state of the process at any point.  If we stopped the computation between
steps, all we would need to do to resume the computation is to supply the
interpreter with the values of the three program variables.  Not so with the
recursive process.  In this case there is some additional &ldquo;hidden&rdquo;
information, maintained by the interpreter and not contained in the program
variables, which indicates &ldquo;where the process is&rdquo; in negotiating the chain of
deferred operations.  The longer the chain, the more information must be
maintained.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF30" href="#FOOT30"><sup>30</sup></a>
</p>
<p>In contrasting iteration and recursion, we must be careful not to confuse the
notion of a recursive <span id="index-process"></span>
<em>process</em> with the notion of a recursive
<span id="index-procedure"></span>
<em>procedure</em>.  When we describe a procedure as recursive, we are
referring to the syntactic fact that the procedure definition refers (either
directly or indirectly) to the procedure itself.  But when we describe a
process as following a pattern that is, say, linearly recursive, we are
speaking about how the process evolves, not about the syntax of how a procedure
is written.  It may seem disturbing that we refer to a recursive procedure such
as <code>fact-iter</code> as generating an iterative process.  However, the process
really is iterative: Its state is captured completely by its three state
variables, and an interpreter need keep track of only three variables in order
to execute the process.
</p>
<p>One reason that the distinction between process and procedure may be confusing
is that most implementations of common languages (including Ada, Pascal, and C)
are designed in such a way that the interpretation of any recursive procedure
consumes an amount of memory that grows with the number of procedure calls,
even when the process described is, in principle, iterative.  As a consequence,
these languages can describe iterative processes only by resorting to
special-purpose &ldquo;looping constructs&rdquo; such as <code>do</code>, <code>repeat</code>,
<code>until</code>, <code>for</code>, and <code>while</code>.  The implementation of Scheme we
shall consider in <a href="Chapter-5.html">Chapter 5</a> does not share this defect.  It will execute
an iterative process in constant space, even if the iterative process is
described by a recursive procedure.  An implementation with this property is
called <span id="index-tail_002drecursive"></span>
<em>tail-recursive</em>.  With a tail-recursive implementation,
iteration can be expressed using the ordinary procedure call mechanism, so that
special iteration constructs are useful only as syntactic sugar.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF31" href="#FOOT31"><sup>31</sup></a>

<span id="g_t1_002e2_002e2"></span><span id="Tree-Recursion"></span><h4 class="subsection"><span class="secnum">1.2.2</span><span class="sectitle">Tree Recursion</span></h4>

<p>Another common pattern of computation is called <span id="index-tree-recursion"></span>
<em>tree recursion</em>.  As
an example, consider computing the sequence of Fibonacci numbers, in which each
number is the sum of the preceding two:
</p>
<div align="center">0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, &hellip;.
</div>
<p>In general, the Fibonacci numbers can be defined by the rule

\[ % :7:
  
\text{Fib}(n) \; = \;
  \left\{ 
    \begin{array}{ll}	 	 
      0 &amp; \;\text{if} \;\; n = 0, \\
      1 &amp; \;\text{if} \;\; n = 1, \\
      \text{Fib}(n-1) + \text{Fib}(n-2) &amp; \;\text{otherwise}. 
    \end{array} 
  \right. 
\]

We can immediately translate this definition into a recursive procedure for
computing Fibonacci numbers:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (fib n)
  (cond ((= n 0) 0)
        ((= n 1) 1)
        (else (+ (fib (- n 1))
                 (fib (- n 2))))))
</pre></div>

<p>Consider the pattern of this computation.  To compute <code>(fib 5)</code>, we
compute <code>(fib 4)</code> and <code>(fib 3)</code>.  To compute <code>(fib 4)</code>, we
compute <code>(fib 3)</code> and <code>(fib 2)</code>.  In general, the evolved process
looks like a tree, as shown in <a href="#Figure-1_002e5">Figure 1.5</a>.  Notice that the branches
split into two at each level (except at the bottom); this reflects the fact
that the <code>fib</code> procedure calls itself twice each time it is invoked.
</p>
<div class="float">
<span id="Figure-1_002e5"></span><img src="fig/chap1/Fig1.5d.std.svg" alt="fig/chap1/Fig1.5d">

<div class="float-caption"><p><strong>Figure 1.5:</strong> The tree-recursive process generated in computing <code>(fib 5)</code>.</p></div></div>
<p>This procedure is instructive as a prototypical tree recursion, but it is a
terrible way to compute Fibonacci numbers because it does so much redundant
computation.  Notice in <a href="#Figure-1_002e5">Figure 1.5</a> that the entire computation of
<code>(fib 3)</code>&mdash;almost half the work&mdash;is duplicated.  In fact, it is not hard
to show that the number of times the procedure will compute <code>(fib 1)</code> or
<code>(fib 0)</code> (the number of leaves in the above tree, in general) is
precisely \( {\text{Fib}(n+1)} \).  To get an idea of how bad this is, one can
show that the value of \( {\text{Fib}(n)} \) grows exponentially with \( n \).  More
precisely (see <a href="#Exercise-1_002e13">Exercise 1.13</a>), \( {\text{Fib}(n)} \) is the closest integer
to \( {\varphi^n / \sqrt{5}} \), where

\[ % :8:

\varphi \,=\, \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \,\approx\, 1.6180
\]

is the <span id="index-golden-ratio"></span>
<em>golden ratio</em>, which satisfies the equation

\[ % :9:
 
\varphi^2 \,=\, {\varphi + 1.}
\]

Thus, the process uses a number of steps that grows exponentially with the
input.  On the other hand, the space required grows only linearly with the
input, because we need keep track only of which nodes are above us in the tree
at any point in the computation.  In general, the number of steps required by a
tree-recursive process will be proportional to the number of nodes in the tree,
while the space required will be proportional to the maximum depth of the tree.
</p>
<p>We can also formulate an iterative process for computing the Fibonacci numbers.
The idea is to use a pair of integers \( a \) and \( b \), initialized to
\( {\text{Fib(1) = 1}} \) and \( {\text{Fib(0) = 0}} \), and to repeatedly apply the
simultaneous transformations
</p>

\[ % :10:
 
\begin{array}{l}
  a \;\leftarrow\; a + b, \\ 
  b \;\leftarrow\; a. 
\end{array}
\]

<p>It is not hard to show that, after applying this transformation \( n \) times,
\( a \) and \( b \) will be equal, respectively, to \( {\text{Fib}(n+1)} \) and
\( {\text{Fib}(n)} \).  Thus, we can compute Fibonacci numbers iteratively using
the procedure
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (fib n) 
  (fib-iter 1 0 n))

(define (fib-iter a b count)
  (if (= count 0)
      b
      (fib-iter (+ a b) a (- count 1))))
</pre></div>

<p>This second method for computing \( {\text{Fib}(n)} \) is a linear iteration.  The
difference in number of steps required by the two methods&mdash;one linear in
\( n \), one growing as fast as \( {\text{Fib}(n)} \) itself&mdash;is enormous, even for
small inputs.
</p>
<p>One should not conclude from this that tree-recursive processes are useless.
When we consider processes that operate on hierarchically structured data
rather than numbers, we will find that tree recursion is a natural and powerful
tool.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF32" href="#FOOT32"><sup>32</sup></a> But
even in numerical operations, tree-recursive processes can be useful in helping
us to understand and design programs.  For instance, although the first
<code>fib</code> procedure is much less efficient than the second one, it is more
straightforward, being little more than a translation into Lisp of the
definition of the Fibonacci sequence.  To formulate the iterative algorithm
required noticing that the computation could be recast as an iteration with
three state variables.
</p>
<span id="Example_003a-Counting-change"></span><h4 class="subsubheading">Example: Counting change</h4>

<p>It takes only a bit of cleverness to come up with the iterative Fibonacci
algorithm.  In contrast, consider the following problem: How many different
ways can we make change of $1.00, given half-dollars, quarters, dimes,
nickels, and pennies?  More generally, can we write a procedure to compute the
number of ways to change any given amount of money?
</p>
<p>This problem has a simple solution as a recursive procedure.  Suppose we think
of the types of coins available as arranged in some order.  Then the following
relation holds:
</p>
<p>The number of ways to change amount \( a \) using \( n \) kinds of coins equals
</p>
<ul>
<li> the number of ways to change amount \( a \) using all but the first kind of coin,
plus

</li><li> the number of ways to change amount \( {a - d} \) using all \( n \) kinds of
coins, where \( d \) is the denomination of the first kind of coin.

</li></ul>

<p>To see why this is true, observe that the ways to make change can be divided
into two groups: those that do not use any of the first kind of coin, and those
that do.  Therefore, the total number of ways to make change for some amount is
equal to the number of ways to make change for the amount without using any of
the first kind of coin, plus the number of ways to make change assuming that we
do use the first kind of coin.  But the latter number is equal to the number of
ways to make change for the amount that remains after using a coin of the first
kind.
</p>
<p>Thus, we can recursively reduce the problem of changing a given amount to the
problem of changing smaller amounts using fewer kinds of coins.  Consider this
reduction rule carefully, and convince yourself that we can use it to describe
an algorithm if we specify the following degenerate cases:<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF33" href="#FOOT33"><sup>33</sup></a>
</p>
<ul>
<li> If \( a \) is exactly 0, we should count that as 1 way to make change.

</li><li> If \( a \) is less than 0, we should count that as 0 ways to make change.

</li><li> If \( n \) is 0, we should count that as 0 ways to make change.

</li></ul>

<p>We can easily translate this description into a recursive procedure:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (count-change amount)
  (cc amount 5))

(define (cc amount kinds-of-coins)
  (cond ((= amount 0) 1)
        ((or (&lt; amount 0) 
             (= kinds-of-coins 0)) 
         0)
        (else 
         (+ (cc amount (- kinds-of-coins 1))
            (cc (- amount (first-denomination 
                           kinds-of-coins))
                kinds-of-coins)))))

(define (first-denomination kinds-of-coins)
  (cond ((= kinds-of-coins 1) 1)
        ((= kinds-of-coins 2) 5)
        ((= kinds-of-coins 3) 10)
        ((= kinds-of-coins 4) 25)
        ((= kinds-of-coins 5) 50)))
</pre></div>

<p>(The <code>first-denomination</code> procedure takes as input the number of kinds of
coins available and returns the denomination of the first kind.  Here we are
thinking of the coins as arranged in order from largest to smallest, but any
order would do as well.)  We can now answer our original question about
changing a dollar:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(count-change 100)
<i>292</i>
</pre></div>

<p><code>Count-change</code> generates a tree-recursive process with redundancies
similar to those in our first implementation of <code>fib</code>.  (It will take
quite a while for that 292 to be computed.)  On the other hand, it is not
obvious how to design a better algorithm for computing the result, and we leave
this problem as a challenge.  The observation that a tree-recursive process may
be highly inefficient but often easy to specify and understand has led people
to propose that one could get the best of both worlds by designing a &ldquo;smart
compiler&rdquo; that could transform tree-recursive procedures into more efficient
procedures that compute the same result.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF34" href="#FOOT34"><sup>34</sup></a>

<p>The previous examples illustrate that processes can differ considerably in the
rates at which they consume computational resources.  One convenient way to
describe this difference is to use the notion of <span id="index-order-of-growth"></span>
<em>order of growth</em> to
obtain a gross measure of the resources required by a process as the inputs
become larger.
</p>
<p>Let \( n \) be a parameter that measures the size of the problem, and let
\( {R(n)} \) be the amount of resources the process requires for a problem of
size \( n \).  In our previous examples we took \( n \) to be the number for which
a given function is to be computed, but there are other possibilities.  For
instance, if our goal is to compute an approximation to the square root of a
number, we might take \( n \) to be the number of digits accuracy required.  For
matrix multiplication we might take \( n \) to be the number of rows in the
matrices.  In general there are a number of properties of the problem with
respect to which it will be desirable to analyze a given process.  Similarly,
\( {R(n)} \) might measure the number of internal storage registers used, the
number of elementary machine operations performed, and so on.  In computers
that do only a fixed number of operations at a time, the time required will be
proportional to the number of elementary machine operations performed.
</p>
<p>We say that \( {R(n)} \) has order of growth \( {\Theta(f(n))} \), written
\( {R(n)} = {\Theta(f(n))} \) (pronounced &ldquo;theta of
\( {f(n)} \)&rdquo;), if there are positive constants \( k_1 \) and \( k_2 \)
independent of \( n \) such that \( {k_1 f(n)} \le {R(n)} \le {k_2 f(n)} \) 
for any sufficiently large value of \( n \).  (In other words, for large \( n \),
the value \( {R(n)} \) is sandwiched between \( {k_1 f(n)} \) and
\( {k_2 f(n)} \).)
</p>
<p>For instance, with the linear recursive process for computing factorial
described in <a href="#g_t1_002e2_002e1">1.2.1</a> the number of steps grows proportionally to
the input \( n \).  Thus, the steps required for this process grows as
\( {\Theta(n)} \).  We also saw that the space required grows as
\( {\Theta(n)} \).  For the iterative factorial, the number of steps is still
\( {\Theta(n)} \) but the space is \( {\Theta(1)} \)&mdash;that is,
constant.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF36" href="#FOOT36"><sup>36</sup></a> The
tree-recursive Fibonacci computation requires \( {\Theta(\varphi^n)} \)
steps and space \( {\Theta(n)} \), where \( \varphi \) is the golden ratio
described in <a href="#g_t1_002e2_002e2">1.2.2</a>.
</p>
<p>Orders of growth provide only a crude description of the behavior of a process.
For example, a process requiring \( n^2 \) steps and a process requiring
\( {1000n^2} \) steps and a process requiring \( {3n^2} + {10n} + 17 \) steps all
have \( {\Theta(n^2)} \) order of growth.  On the other hand, order of growth
provides a useful indication of how we may expect the behavior of the process
to change as we change the size of the problem.  For a \( {\Theta(n)} \)
(linear) process, doubling the size will roughly double the amount of resources
used.  For an exponential process, each increment in problem size will multiply
the resource utilization by a constant factor.  In the remainder of 
<a href="#g_t1_002e2">1.2</a> we will examine two algorithms whose order of growth is logarithmic,
so that doubling the problem size increases the resource requirement by a
constant amount.

<p>Consider the problem of computing the exponential of a given number.  We would
like a procedure that takes as arguments a base \( b \) and a positive integer
exponent \( n \) and computes \( b^n \).  One way to do this is via the
recursive definition

\[ % :13:
 
\begin{array}{l}
  b^n \,=\, b\cdot b^{n-1}, \\ 
  b^0 \,=\, 1, 
\end{array}
\]

which translates readily into the procedure
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (expt b n)
  (if (= n 0) 
      1 
      (* b (expt b (- n 1)))))
</pre></div>

<p>This is a linear recursive process, which requires \( {\Theta(n)} \) steps and
\( {\Theta(n)} \) space.  Just as with factorial, we can readily formulate an
equivalent linear iteration:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (expt b n) 
  (expt-iter b n 1))

(define (expt-iter b counter product)
  (if (= counter 0)
      product
      (expt-iter b
                 (- counter 1)
                 (* b product))))
</pre></div>

<p>This version requires \( {\Theta(n)} \) steps and \( {\Theta(1)} \) space.
</p>
<p>We can compute exponentials in fewer steps by using successive squaring.  For
instance, rather than computing \( b^8 \) as

\[ % :14:
  
{b\cdot (b\cdot (b}\cdot {(b\cdot (b\cdot (b}\cdot {(b\cdot b)))))),}
\]

we can compute it using three multiplications:

\[ % :15:
 
\begin{array}{l}
  b^2 \,=\, b\cdot b, \\ 
  b^4 \,=\, b^2\cdot b^2, \\
  b^8 \,=\, b^4\cdot b^4.
\end{array}
\]

This method works fine for exponents that are powers of 2.  We can also take
advantage of successive squaring in computing exponentials in general if we use
the rule

\[ % :16:
 
\begin{array}{ll}
  b^n \,=\, (b^{n / 2})^2   &amp; \text{if} \; n \; \text{is even}, \\
  b^n \,=\, b\cdot b^{n-1}  &amp; \text{if} \; n \; \text{is odd}.
\end{array}
\]

We can express this method as a procedure:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (fast-expt b n)
  (cond ((= n 0) 
         1)
        ((even? n) 
         (square (fast-expt b (/ n 2))))
        (else 
         (* b (fast-expt b (- n 1))))))
</pre></div>

<p>where the predicate to test whether an integer is even is defined in terms of
the primitive procedure <code>remainder</code> by
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (even? n)
  (= (remainder n 2) 0))
</pre></div>

<p>The process evolved by <code>fast-expt</code> grows logarithmically with \( n \) in
both space and number of steps.  To see this, observe that computing
\( b^{2n} \) using <code>fast-expt</code> requires only one more multiplication
than computing \( b^n \).  The size of the exponent we can compute therefore
doubles (approximately) with every new multiplication we are allowed.  Thus,
the number of multiplications required for an exponent of \( n \) grows about as
fast as the logarithm of \( n \) to the base 2.  The process has
\( {\Theta(\log n)} \) growth.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF37" href="#FOOT37"><sup>37</sup></a>
</p>
<p>The difference between \( {\Theta(\log n)} \) growth and
\( {\Theta(n)} \) growth becomes striking as \( n \) becomes large.  For
example, <code>fast-expt</code> for \( n \) = 1000 requires only 14
multiplications.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF38" href="#FOOT38"><sup>38</sup></a> It is also possible to
use the idea of successive squaring to devise an iterative algorithm that
computes exponentials with a logarithmic number of steps (see <a href="#Exercise-1_002e16">Exercise 1.16</a>), 
although, as is often the case with iterative algorithms, this is not
written down so straightforwardly as the recursive algorithm.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF39" href="#FOOT39"><sup>39</sup></a>

Call this transformation \( T \), and observe that applying \( T \) over and over
again \( n \) times, starting with 1 and 0, produces the pair \( {\text{Fib}(n+1)} \) and 
\( {\text{Fib}(n)} \).  In other words, the Fibonacci numbers are produced
by applying \( T^n \), the \( n^{\text{th}} \) power of the transformation \( T \),
starting with the pair (1, 0).  Now consider \( T \) to be the special case of
\( {p=0} \) and \( {q=1} \) in a family of transformations \( T_{pq} \),
where \( T_{pq} \) transforms the pair \( {(a, b)} \) according to

Show that if we apply such a transformation \( T_{pq} \) twice, the

<p>The greatest common divisor (<abbr>GCD</abbr>) of two integers \( a \) and \( b \) is
defined to be the largest integer that divides both \( a \) and \( b \) with no
remainder.  For example, the <abbr>GCD</abbr> of 16 and 28 is 4.  In <a href="Chapter-2.html">Chapter 2</a>, when we investigate how to implement rational-number arithmetic, we will
need to be able to compute <abbr>GCD</abbr>s in order to reduce rational numbers
to lowest terms.  (To reduce a rational number to lowest terms, we must divide
both the numerator and the denominator by their <abbr>GCD</abbr>.  For example,
16/28 reduces to 4/7.)  One way to find the <abbr>GCD</abbr> of two integers is to
factor them and search for common factors, but there is a famous algorithm that

</p>
<p>The fact that the number of steps required by Euclid&rsquo;s Algorithm has

</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Lam&eacute;&rsquo;s Theorem:</strong> If Euclid&rsquo;s Algorithm requires \( k \) steps to

<p>We can use this theorem to get an order-of-growth estimate for Euclid&rsquo;s

the process takes \( k \) steps, then we must have 
\( n \ge {\text{Fib}(k)} \approx {\varphi^k / \sqrt{5}} \).  Therefore the number of steps \( k \)

<p>Since ancient times, mathematicians have been fascinated by problems concerning
prime numbers, and many people have worked on the problem of determining ways
to test if numbers are prime.  One way to test if a number is prime is to find
the number&rsquo;s divisors.  The following program finds the smallest integral
divisor (greater than 1) of a given number \( n \).  It does this in a
straightforward way, by testing \( n \) for divisibility by successive integers
starting with 2.
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (smallest-divisor n)
  (find-divisor n 2))

(define (find-divisor n test-divisor)
  (cond ((&gt; (square test-divisor) n)

         test-divisor)
        (else (find-divisor 
               n 
               (+ test-divisor 1)))))

(define (divides? a b)
  (= (remainder b a) 0))
</pre></div>

<p>We can test whether a number is prime as follows: \( n \) is prime if and only if
\( n \) is its own smallest divisor.
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (prime? n)
  (= n (smallest-divisor n)))
</pre></div>

<p>The end test for <code>find-divisor</code> is based on the fact that if \( n \) is not
prime it must have a divisor less than or equal to
\( \sqrt{n} \).<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF44" href="#FOOT44"><sup>44</sup></a>  This means that the algorithm need only test divisors
between 1 and \( \sqrt{n} \).  Consequently, the number of steps required

<span id="The-Fermat-test"></span><h4 class="subsubheading">The Fermat test</h4>

</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Fermat&rsquo;s Little Theorem:</strong> If \( n \) is a prime number and \( a \) is any
positive integer less than \( n \), then \( a \) raised to the \( n^{\text{th}} \) power is
congruent to \( a \) modulo \( n \).
</p></blockquote>

<p>(Two numbers are said to be <span id="index-congruent-modulo"></span>
<em>congruent modulo</em> \( n \) if they both have
the same remainder when divided by \( n \).  The remainder of a number \( a \) when
divided by \( n \) is also referred to as the <span id="index-remainder-of"></span>
<em>remainder of</em> \( a \)
<span id="index-modulo"></span>
<em>modulo</em> \( n \), or simply as \( a \) <span id="index-modulo-1"></span>
<em>modulo</em> \( n \).)
</p>
<p>If \( n \) is not prime, then, in general, most of the numbers \( {a &lt; n} \) will
not satisfy the above relation.  This leads to the following algorithm for
testing primality: Given a number \( n \), pick a random number \( {a &lt; n} \) and
compute the remainder of \( a^n \) modulo \( n \).  If the result is not equal
to \( a \), then \( n \) is certainly not prime.  If it is \( a \), then chances are
good that \( n \) is prime.  Now pick another random number \( a \) and test it
with the same method.  If it also satisfies the equation, then we can be even
more confident that \( n \) is prime.  By trying more and more values of \( a \),
we can increase our confidence in the result.  This algorithm is known as the
Fermat test.
</p>
<p>To implement the Fermat test, we need a procedure that computes the exponential
of a number modulo another number:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (expmod base exp m)
  (cond ((= exp 0) 1)
        ((even? exp)
         (remainder 
          (square (expmod base (/ exp 2) m))
          m))
        (else
         (remainder 
          (* base (expmod base (- exp 1) m))
          m))))
</pre></div>

<p>This is very similar to the <code>fast-expt</code> procedure of <a href="#g_t1_002e2_002e4">1.2.4</a>.
It uses successive squaring, so that the number of steps grows logarithmically
with the exponent.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF46" href="#FOOT46"><sup>46</sup></a>
</p>
<p>The Fermat test is performed by choosing at random a number \( a \) between 1 and
\( {n-1} \) inclusive and checking whether the remainder modulo \( n \) of the
\( n^{\text{th}} \) power of \( a \) is equal to \( a \).  The random number \( a \) is chosen
using the procedure <code>random</code>, which we assume is included as a primitive
in Scheme. <code>Random</code> returns a nonnegative integer less than its integer
input.  Hence, to obtain a random number between 1 and \( {n-1} \), we call
<code>random</code> with an input of \( {n-1} \) and add 1 to the result:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (fermat-test n)
  (define (try-it a)
    (= (expmod a n n) a))
  (try-it (+ 1 (random (- n 1)))))
</pre></div>

<p>The following procedure runs the test a given number of times, as specified by
a parameter.  Its value is true if the test succeeds every time, and false
otherwise.
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (fast-prime? n times)
  (cond ((= times 0) true)
        ((fermat-test n) 
         (fast-prime? n (- times 1)))
        (else false)))
</pre></div>

<span id="Probabilistic-methods"></span><h4 class="subsubheading">Probabilistic methods</h4>

<p>The Fermat test differs in character from most familiar algorithms, in which
one computes an answer that is guaranteed to be correct.  Here, the answer
obtained is only probably correct.  More precisely, if \( n \) ever fails the
Fermat test, we can be certain that \( n \) is not prime.  But the fact that
\( n \) passes the test, while an extremely strong indication, is still not a
guarantee that \( n \) is prime.  What we would like to say is that for any
number \( n \), if we perform the test enough times and find that \( n \) always
passes the test, then the probability of error in our primality test can be
made as small as we like.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this assertion is not quite correct.  There do exist numbers
that fool the Fermat test: numbers \( n \) that are not prime and yet have the
property that \( a^n \) is congruent to \( a \) modulo \( n \) for all integers
\( {a &lt; n} \).  Such numbers are extremely rare, so the Fermat test is quite
reliable in practice.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF47" href="#FOOT47"><sup>47</sup></a>
</p>
<p>There are variations of the Fermat test that cannot be fooled.  In these tests,
as with the Fermat method, one tests the primality of an integer \( n \) by
choosing a random integer \( {a &lt; n} \) and checking some condition that depends
upon \( n \) and \( a \).  (See <a href="#Exercise-1_002e28">Exercise 1.28</a> for an example of such a test.)
On the other hand, in contrast to the Fermat test, one can prove that, for any
\( n \), the condition does not hold for most of the integers \( {a &lt; n} \) unless
\( n \) is prime.  Thus, if \( n \) passes the test for some random choice of
\( a \), the chances are better than even that \( n \) is prime.  If \( n \) passes
the test for two random choices of \( a \), the chances are better than 3 out of
4 that \( n \) is prime. By running the test with more and more randomly chosen
values of \( a \) we can make the probability of error as small as we like.
</p>
<p>The existence of tests for which one can prove that the chance of error becomes
arbitrarily small has sparked interest in algorithms of this type, which have
come to be known as <span id="index-probabilistic-algorithms"></span>
<em>probabilistic algorithms</em>.  There is a great deal
of research activity in this area, and probabilistic algorithms have been
fruitfully applied to many fields.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF48" href="#FOOT48"><sup>48</sup></a>

Tail

One approach to coping with
redundant computations is to arrange matters so that we automatically construct
a table of values as they are computed.  Each time we are asked to apply the
procedure to some argument, we first look to see if the value is already stored
in the table, in which case we avoid performing the redundant computation.
This strategy, known as <span id="index-tabulation"></span>
<em>tabulation</em> or <span id="index-memoization"></span>
<em>memoization</em>, can be
implemented in a straightforward way.  Tabulation can sometimes be used to
transform processes that require an exponential number of steps (such as

linearly with the input.  See <a href="3_002e3.html#Exercise-3_002e27">Exercise 3.27</a>.</p>

These statements mask a great deal of oversimplification.

the assumption that the number of machine operations needed to perform, say, a
multiplication is independent of the size of the numbers to be multiplied,

This
theorem was proved in 1845 by Gabriel Lam&eacute;, a French mathematician and
engineer known chiefly for his contributions to mathematical physics.  To prove
the theorem, we consider pairs \( {(a_k, b_k)} \), where \( {a_k \ge b_k} \), 
for which Euclid&rsquo;s Algorithm terminates in \( k \) steps.  The proof
is based on the claim that, if \( {(a_{k+1}, b_{k+1})} \to {(a_k, b_k)} \to {(a_{k-1}, b_{k-1})} \) 
are three successive pairs 
in the reduction process, then we must have \( b_{k+1} \ge b_k + b_{k-1} \).  
To verify the claim, consider that a reduction step is defined by applying the 
transformation \( {a_{k-1} = b_k} \), \( {b_{k-1} =} \) remainder of \( a_k \) 
divided by \( b_k \).  The second equation means that \( a_k = {qb_k} + {b_{k-1}} \) 
for some positive integer \( q \).  And since \( q \) must be at least 1 we have 
\( a_k = {qb_k} + b_{k-1} \ge b_k + b_{k-1} \).  But in the previous reduction 
step we have \( b_{k+1} = a_k \).  Therefore, \( b_{k+1} = a_k \ge b_k + b_{k-1} \).
This verifies the claim.  Now we can prove the theorem by induction on \( k \), 
the number of steps that the algorithm requires to terminate.  The result is true for 
\( {k = 1} \), since this merely requires that \( b \) be at least as large as \( {\text{Fib}(1) = 1} \).  
Now, assume that the result is true for all integers less than or equal
to \( k \) and establish the result for \( {k + 1} \).  
Let \( {(a_{k+1}, b_{k+1})} \to {(a_k, b_k)} \to {(a_{k-1}, b_{k-1})} \) 
be successive pairs in the reduction 
process.  By our induction hypotheses, we have \( b_{k-1} \ge {\text{Fib}(k - 1)} \) 
and \( b_k \ge {\text{Fib}(k)} \).  Thus, applying the claim we just proved together with 
the definition of the Fibonacci numbers gives 
\( b_{k+1} \ge b_k + b_{k-1} \ge {\text{Fib}(k)} + {\text{Fib}(k-1)} = {\text{Fib}(k+1)} \), 
which completes the proof of Lam&eacute;&rsquo;s Theorem.</p>

Pierre de Fermat
(1601-1665) is considered to be the founder of modern number theory.  He
obtained many important number-theoretic results, but he usually announced just
the results, without providing his proofs.  Fermat&rsquo;s Little Theorem was stated
in a letter he wrote in 1640.  The first published proof was given by Euler in
1736 (and an earlier, identical proof was discovered in the unpublished
manuscripts of Leibniz).  The most famous of Fermat&rsquo;s results&mdash;known as
Fermat&rsquo;s Last Theorem&mdash;was jotted down in 1637 in his copy of the book
<cite>Arithmetic</cite> (by the third-century Greek mathematician Diophantus) with
the remark &ldquo;I have discovered a truly remarkable proof, but this margin is too
small to contain it.&rdquo;  Finding a proof of Fermat&rsquo;s Last Theorem became one of
the most famous challenges in number theory.  A complete solution was finally
given in 1995 by Andrew Wiles of Princeton University.</p>

The reduction steps in the cases where the exponent
\( e \) is greater than 1 are based on the fact that, for any integers \( x \),
\( y \), and \( m \), we can find the remainder of \( x \) times \( y \) modulo \( m \)
by computing separately the remainders of \( x \) modulo \( m \) and \( y \) modulo
\( m \), multiplying these, and then taking the remainder of the result modulo
\( m \).  For instance, in the case where \( e \) is even, we compute the remainder
of \( b^{e / 2} \) modulo \( m \), square this, and take the remainder modulo
\( m \).  This technique is useful because it means we can perform our
computation without ever having to deal with numbers much larger than \( m \).

2465, 2821, and 6601.  In testing primality of very large numbers chosen at
random, the chance of stumbling upon a value that fools the Fermat test is less
than the chance that cosmic radiation will cause the computer to make an error
in carrying out a &ldquo;correct&rdquo; algorithm.  Considering an algorithm to be
inadequate for the first reason but not for the second illustrates the
difference between mathematics and engineering.</p>

One of the most striking
applications of probabilistic prime testing has been to the field of
cryptography.  Although it is now computationally infeasible to factor an
arbitrary 200-digit number, the primality of such a number can be checked in a
few seconds with the Fermat test.  This fact forms the basis of a technique for
constructing &ldquo;unbreakable codes&rdquo; suggested by <a href="References.html#Rivest-et-al_002e-_00281977_0029">Rivest et al. (1977)</a>.  
The resulting <span id="index-RSA-algorithm"></span>
<em>RSA algorithm</em> has become a widely used
technique for enhancing the security of electronic communications.  Because of
this and related developments, the study of prime numbers, once considered the
epitome of a topic in &ldquo;pure&rdquo; mathematics to be studied only for its own sake,
now turns out to have important practical applications to cryptography,
electronic funds transfer, and information retrieval.</p>
