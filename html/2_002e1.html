<span id="Introduction-to-Data-Abstraction"></span><h3 class="section"><span class="secnum">2.1</span><span class="sectitle">Introduction to Data Abstraction</span></h3>

<p>In <a href="1_002e1.html#g_t1_002e1_002e8">1.1.8</a>, we noted that a procedure used as an element in
creating a more complex procedure could be regarded not only as a collection of
particular operations but also as a procedural abstraction.  That is, the
details of how the procedure was implemented could be suppressed, and the
particular procedure itself could be replaced by any other procedure with the
same overall behavior.  In other words, we could make an abstraction that would
separate the way the procedure would be used from the details of how the
procedure would be implemented in terms of more primitive procedures.  The
analogous notion for compound data is called <span id="index-data-abstraction-1"></span>
<em>data abstraction</em>.  Data
abstraction is a methodology that enables us to isolate how a compound data
object is used from the details of how it is constructed from more primitive
data objects.
</p>
<p>The basic idea of data abstraction is to structure the programs that are to use
compound data objects so that they operate on &ldquo;abstract data.&rdquo; That is, our
programs should use data in such a way as to make no assumptions about the data
that are not strictly necessary for performing the task at hand.  At the same
time, a &ldquo;concrete&rdquo; data representation is defined independent of the programs
that use the data.  The interface between these two parts of our system will be
a set of procedures, called <span id="index-selectors"></span>
<em>selectors</em> and <span id="index-constructors"></span>
<em>constructors</em>,
that implement the abstract data in terms of the concrete representation.  To
illustrate this technique, we will consider how to design a set of procedures
for manipulating rational numbers.
</p>

<hr>
<span id="g_t2_002e1_002e1"></span><span id="Example_003a-Arithmetic-Operations-for-Rational-Numbers"></span><h4 class="subsection"><span class="secnum">2.1.1</span><span class="sectitle">Example: Arithmetic Operations for Rational Numbers</span></h4>

<p>Suppose we want to do arithmetic with rational numbers.  We want to be able to
add, subtract, multiply, and divide them and to test whether two rational
numbers are equal.
</p>
<p>Let us begin by assuming that we already have a way of constructing a rational
number from a numerator and a denominator.  We also assume that, given a
rational number, we have a way of extracting (or selecting) its numerator and
its denominator.  Let us further assume that the constructor and selectors are
available as procedures:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <code>(make-rat ⟨<var>n</var>⟩ ⟨<var>d</var>⟩)</code> returns the rational number whose numerator 
is the integer <code>⟨<var>n</var>⟩</code> and whose denominator is the integer 
<code>⟨<var>d</var>⟩</code>.

</li><li> <code>(numer ⟨<var>x</var>⟩)</code> returns the numerator of the rational number 
<code>⟨<var>x</var>⟩</code>.

</li><li> <code>(denom ⟨<var>x</var>⟩)</code> returns the denominator of the rational number 
<code>⟨<var>x</var>⟩</code>.

</li></ul>

<p>We are using here a powerful strategy of synthesis: <span id="index-wishful-thinking"></span>
<em>wishful thinking</em>.
We haven&rsquo;t yet said how a rational number is represented, or how the procedures
<code>numer</code>, <code>denom</code>, and <code>make-rat</code> should be implemented.  Even
so, if we did have these three procedures, we could then add, subtract,
multiply, divide, and test equality by using the following relations:
\[ % :30:
 
\begin{eqnarray}
{n_1 \over d_1} + {n_2 \over d_2}       &amp;=&amp; {n_1 d_2 + n_2 d_1 \over d_1 d_2}, \\
{n_1 \over d_1} - {n_2 \over d_2} 	&amp;=&amp; {n_1 d_2 - n_2 d_1 \over d_1 d_2}, \\
{n_1 \over d_1} \times {n_2 \over d_2} 	&amp;=&amp; {n_1 n_2 \over d_1 d_2}, \\
{n_1 \,/\, d_1} \over {n_2 \,/\, d_2} 	&amp;=&amp; {n_1 d_2 \over d_1 n_2}, \\
{n_1 \over d_1} 			&amp;=&amp; {n_2 \over d_2} \quad
						{\rm\ if\ and\ only\ if\quad} 
						n_1 d_2 = n_2 d_1. 
\end{eqnarray}
\]
We can express these rules as procedures:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (add-rat x y)
  (make-rat (+ (* (numer x) (denom y))
               (* (numer y) (denom x)))
            (* (denom x) (denom y))))

(define (sub-rat x y)
  (make-rat (- (* (numer x) (denom y))
               (* (numer y) (denom x)))
            (* (denom x) (denom y))))

(define (mul-rat x y)
  (make-rat (* (numer x) (numer y))
            (* (denom x) (denom y))))

(define (div-rat x y)
  (make-rat (* (numer x) (denom y))
            (* (denom x) (numer y))))

(define (equal-rat? x y)
  (= (* (numer x) (denom y))
     (* (numer y) (denom x))))
</pre></div>

<p>Now we have the operations on rational numbers defined in terms of the selector
and constructor procedures <code>numer</code>, <code>denom</code>, and <code>make-rat</code>.
But we haven&rsquo;t yet defined these.  What we need is some way to glue together a
numerator and a denominator to form a rational number.
</p>
<span id="Pairs"></span><h4 class="subsubheading">Pairs</h4>

<p>To enable us to implement the concrete level of our data abstraction, our
language provides a compound structure called a <span id="index-pair"></span>
<em>pair</em>, which can be
constructed with the primitive procedure <code>cons</code>.  This procedure takes two
arguments and returns a compound data object that contains the two arguments as
parts.  Given a pair, we can extract the parts using the primitive procedures
<code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code>.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF68" href="#FOOT68"><sup>68</sup></a> Thus, we can use <code>cons</code>, <code>car</code>, and
<code>cdr</code> as follows:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define x (cons 1 2))

(car x)
<i>1</i>

(cdr x)
<i>2</i>
</pre></div>

<p>Notice that a pair is a data object that can be given a name and manipulated,
just like a primitive data object.  Moreover, <code>cons</code> can be used to form
pairs whose elements are pairs, and so on:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define x (cons 1 2))
(define y (cons 3 4))
(define z (cons x y))

(car (car z))
<i>1</i>

(car (cdr z))
<i>3</i>
</pre></div>

<p>In <a href="2_002e2.html#g_t2_002e2">2.2</a> we will see how this ability to combine pairs means that
pairs can be used as general-purpose building blocks to create all sorts of
complex data structures.  The single compound-data primitive <span id="index-pair-1"></span>
<em>pair</em>,
implemented by the procedures <code>cons</code>, <code>car</code>, and <code>cdr</code>, is the
only glue we need.  Data objects constructed from pairs are called
<span id="index-list_002dstructured"></span>
<em>list-structured</em> data.
</p>
<span id="Representing-rational-numbers"></span><h4 class="subsubheading">Representing rational numbers</h4>

<p>Pairs offer a natural way to complete the rational-number system.  Simply
represent a rational number as a pair of two integers: a numerator and a
denominator.  Then <code>make-rat</code>, <code>numer</code>, and <code>denom</code> are readily
implemented as follows:<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF69" href="#FOOT69"><sup>69</sup></a>
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (make-rat n d) (cons n d))
(define (numer x) (car x))
(define (denom x) (cdr x))
</pre></div>

<p>Also, in order to display the results of our computations, we can print
rational numbers by printing the numerator, a slash, and the
denominator:<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF70" href="#FOOT70"><sup>70</sup></a>
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (print-rat x)
  (newline)
  (display (numer x))
  (display &quot;/&quot;)
  (display (denom x)))
</pre></div>

<p>Now we can try our rational-number procedures:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define one-half (make-rat 1 2))
(print-rat one-half)
<i>1/2</i>

(define one-third (make-rat 1 3))
(print-rat
 (add-rat one-half one-third))
<i>5/6</i>

(print-rat
 (mul-rat one-half one-third))
<i>1/6</i>

(print-rat
 (add-rat one-third one-third))
<i>6/9</i>
</pre></div>

<p>As the final example shows, our rational-number implementation does not reduce
rational numbers to lowest terms.  We can remedy this by changing
<code>make-rat</code>. If we have a <code>gcd</code> procedure like the one in 
<a href="1_002e2.html#g_t1_002e2_002e5">1.2.5</a> that produces the greatest common divisor of two integers, we can
use <code>gcd</code> to reduce the numerator and the denominator to lowest terms
before constructing the pair:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (make-rat n d)
  (let ((g (gcd n d)))
    (cons (/ n g) 
          (/ d g))))
</pre></div>

<p>Now we have
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(print-rat 
 (add-rat one-third one-third))
<i>2/3</i>
</pre></div>

<p>as desired.  This modification was accomplished by changing the constructor
<code>make-rat</code> without changing any of the procedures (such as <code>add-rat</code>
and <code>mul-rat</code>) that implement the actual operations.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><span id="Exercise-2_002e1"></span>Exercise 2.1:</strong> Define a better version of
<code>make-rat</code> that handles both positive and negative arguments.
<code>Make-rat</code> should normalize the sign so that if the rational number is
positive, both the numerator and denominator are positive, and if the rational
number is negative, only the numerator is negative.

<span id="g_t2_002e1_002e2"></span><span id="Abstraction-Barriers"></span><h4 class="subsection"><span class="secnum">2.1.2</span><span class="sectitle">Abstraction Barriers</span></h4>

<p>Before continuing with more examples of compound data and data abstraction, let
us consider some of the issues raised by the rational-number example.  We
defined the rational-number operations in terms of a constructor
<code>make-rat</code> and selectors <code>numer</code> and <code>denom</code>.  In general, the
underlying idea of data abstraction is to identify for each type of data object
a basic set of operations in terms of which all manipulations of data objects
of that type will be expressed, and then to use only those operations in
manipulating the data.
</p>
<p>We can envision the structure of the rational-number system as shown in 
<a href="#Figure-2_002e1">Figure 2.1</a>.  The horizontal lines represent <span id="index-abstraction-barriers-1"></span>
<em>abstraction barriers</em> 
that isolate different &ldquo;levels&rdquo; of the system.  At each level, the
barrier separates the programs (above) that use the data abstraction from the
programs (below) that implement the data abstraction.  Programs that use
rational numbers manipulate them solely in terms of the procedures supplied
&ldquo;for public use&rdquo; by the rational-number package: <code>add-rat</code>,
<code>sub-rat</code>, <code>mul-rat</code>, <code>div-rat</code>, and <code>equal-rat?</code>. These,
in turn, are implemented solely in terms of the constructor and selectors
<code>make-rat</code>, <code>numer</code>, and <code>denom</code>, which themselves are
implemented in terms of pairs.  The details of how pairs are implemented are
irrelevant to the rest of the rational-number package so long as pairs can be
manipulated by the use of <code>cons</code>, <code>car</code>, and <code>cdr</code>.  In effect,
procedures at each level are the interfaces that define the abstraction
barriers and connect the different levels.
</p>
<div class="float">
<span id="Figure-2_002e1"></span><img src="fig/chap2/Fig2.1d.std.svg" alt="fig/chap2/Fig2.1d">

<div class="float-caption"><p><strong>Figure 2.1:</strong> Data-abstraction barriers in the rational-number package.</p></div></div>
<p>This simple idea has many advantages.  One advantage is that it makes programs
much easier to maintain and to modify.  Any complex data structure can be
represented in a variety of ways with the primitive data structures provided by
a programming language.  Of course, the choice of representation influences the
programs that operate on it; thus, if the representation were to be changed at
some later time, all such programs might have to be modified accordingly.  This
task could be time-consuming and expensive in the case of large programs unless
the dependence on the representation were to be confined by design to a very
few program modules.
</p>
<p>For example, an alternate way to address the problem of reducing rational
numbers to lowest terms is to perform the reduction whenever we access the
parts of a rational number, rather than when we construct it.  This leads to
different constructor and selector procedures:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (make-rat n d)
  (cons n d))

(define (numer x)
  (let ((g (gcd (car x) (cdr x))))
    (/ (car x) g)))

(define (denom x)
  (let ((g (gcd (car x) (cdr x))))
    (/ (cdr x) g)))
</pre></div>

<p>The difference between this implementation and the previous one lies in when we
compute the <code>gcd</code>.  If in our typical use of rational numbers we access
the numerators and denominators of the same rational numbers many times, it
would be preferable to compute the <code>gcd</code> when the rational numbers are
constructed.  If not, we may be better off waiting until access time to compute
the <code>gcd</code>.  In any case, when we change from one representation to the
other, the procedures <code>add-rat</code>, <code>sub-rat</code>, and so on do not have to
be modified at all.
</p>
<p>Constraining the dependence on the representation to a few interface procedures
helps us design programs as well as modify them, because it allows us to
maintain the flexibility to consider alternate implementations.  To continue
with our simple example, suppose we are designing a rational-number package and
we can&rsquo;t decide initially whether to perform the <code>gcd</code> at construction
time or at selection time.  The data-abstraction methodology gives us a way to
defer that decision without losing the ability to make progress on the rest of
the system.

<p><strong><span id="Exercise-2_002e2"></span>Exercise 2.2:</strong> Consider the problem of
representing line segments in a plane.  Each segment is represented as a pair
of points: a starting point and an ending point.  Define a constructor
<code>make-segment</code> and selectors <code>start-segment</code> and <code>end-segment</code>

point can be represented as a pair of numbers: the \( x \) coordinate and the
\( y \) coordinate.  Accordingly, specify a constructor <code>make-point</code> and
selectors <code>x-point</code> and <code>y-point</code> that define this representation.
Finally, using your selectors and constructors, define a procedure
<code>midpoint-segment</code> that takes a line segment as argument and returns its
midpoint (the point whose coordinates are the average of the coordinates of the
endpoints).  To try your procedures, you&rsquo;ll need a way to print points:

<span id="g_t2_002e1_002e3"></span><span id="What-Is-Meant-by-Data_003f"></span><h4 class="subsection"><span class="secnum">2.1.3</span><span class="sectitle">What Is Meant by Data?</span></h4>

<p>We began the rational-number implementation in <a href="#g_t2_002e1_002e1">2.1.1</a> by
implementing the rational-number operations <code>add-rat</code>, <code>sub-rat</code>, and
so on in terms of three unspecified procedures: <code>make-rat</code>, <code>numer</code>,
and <code>denom</code>.  At that point, we could think of the operations as being
defined in terms of data objects&mdash;numerators, denominators, and rational
numbers&mdash;whose behavior was specified by the latter three procedures.
</p>
<p>But exactly what is meant by <span id="index-data-1"></span>
<em>data</em>?  It is not enough to say
&ldquo;whatever is implemented by the given selectors and constructors.&rdquo;  Clearly,
not every arbitrary set of three procedures can serve as an appropriate basis
for the rational-number implementation.  We need to guarantee that, if we
construct a rational number <code>x</code> from a pair of integers <code>n</code> and
<code>d</code>, then extracting the <code>numer</code> and the <code>denom</code> of <code>x</code> and
dividing them should yield the same result as dividing <code>n</code> by <code>d</code>.
In other words, <code>make-rat</code>, <code>numer</code>, and <code>denom</code> must satisfy
the condition that, for any integer <code>n</code> and any non-zero integer <code>d</code>,
if <code>x</code> is <code>(make-rat n d)</code>, then
\[ % :31:
  {\text{(numer x)} \over \text{(denom x)}} = {{\text{n} \over \text{d}}.}   \]
In fact, this is the only condition <code>make-rat</code>, <code>numer</code>, and
<code>denom</code> must fulfill in order to form a suitable basis for a
rational-number representation.  In general, we can think of data as defined by
some collection of selectors and constructors, together with specified
conditions that these procedures must fulfill in order to be a valid
representation.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF71" href="#FOOT71"><sup>71</sup></a>
</p>
<p>This point of view can serve to define not only &ldquo;high-level&rdquo; data objects,
such as rational numbers, but lower-level objects as well.  Consider the notion
of a pair, which we used in order to define our rational numbers.  We never
actually said what a pair was, only that the language supplied procedures
<code>cons</code>, <code>car</code>, and <code>cdr</code> for operating on pairs.  But the only
thing we need to know about these three operations is that if we glue two
objects together using <code>cons</code> we can retrieve the objects using <code>car</code>
and <code>cdr</code>.  That is, the operations satisfy the condition that, for any
objects <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, if <code>z</code> is <code>(cons x y)</code> then <code>(car
z)</code> is <code>x</code> and <code>(cdr z)</code> is <code>y</code>.  Indeed, we mentioned that
these three procedures are included as primitives in our language.  However,
any triple of procedures that satisfies the above condition can be used as the
basis for implementing pairs.  This point is illustrated strikingly by the fact
that we could implement <code>cons</code>, <code>car</code>, and <code>cdr</code> without using
any data structures at all but only using procedures.  Here are the
definitions:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (cons x y)
  (define (dispatch m)
    (cond ((= m 0) x)
          ((= m 1) y)
          (else 
           (error &quot;Argument not 0 or 1:
                   CONS&quot; m))))
  dispatch)

(define (car z) (z 0))
(define (cdr z) (z 1))
</pre></div>

<p>This use of procedures corresponds to nothing like our intuitive notion of what
data should be.  Nevertheless, all we need to do to show that this is a valid
way to represent pairs is to verify that these procedures satisfy the condition
given above.
</p>
<p>The subtle point to notice is that the value returned by <code>(cons x y)</code> is a
procedure&mdash;namely the internally defined procedure <code>dispatch</code>, which
takes one argument and returns either <code>x</code> or <code>y</code> depending on whether
the argument is 0 or 1.  Correspondingly, <code>(car z)</code> is defined to apply
<code>z</code> to 0.  Hence, if <code>z</code> is the procedure formed by <code>(cons x
y)</code>, then <code>z</code> applied to 0 will yield <code>x</code>. Thus, we have shown that
<code>(car (cons x y))</code> yields <code>x</code>, as desired.  Similarly, <code>(cdr
(cons x y))</code> applies the procedure returned by <code>(cons x y)</code> to 1, which
returns <code>y</code>.  Therefore, this procedural implementation of pairs is a
valid implementation, and if we access pairs using only <code>cons</code>,
<code>car</code>, and <code>cdr</code> we cannot distinguish this implementation from one
that uses &ldquo;real&rdquo; data structures.
</p>
<p>The point of exhibiting the procedural representation of pairs is not that our
language works this way (Scheme, and Lisp systems in general, implement pairs
directly, for efficiency reasons) but that it could work this way.  The
procedural representation, although obscure, is a perfectly adequate way to
represent pairs, since it fulfills the only conditions that pairs need to
fulfill.  This example also demonstrates that the ability to manipulate
procedures as objects automatically provides the ability to represent compound
data.  This may seem a curiosity now, but procedural representations of data
will play a central role in our programming repertoire.  This style of
programming is often called <span id="index-message-passing"></span>
<em>message passing</em>, and we will be using it
as a basic tool in <a href="Chapter-3.html">Chapter 3</a> when we address the issues of modeling and
simulation.

<p>Alyssa P. Hacker is designing a system to help people solve engineering
problems.  One feature she wants to provide in her system is the ability to
manipulate inexact quantities (such as measured parameters of physical devices)
with known precision, so that when computations are done with such approximate
quantities the results will be numbers of known precision.
</p>
<p>Electrical engineers will be using Alyssa&rsquo;s system to compute electrical
quantities.  It is sometimes necessary for them to compute the value of a
parallel equivalent resistance \( R_p \) of two resistors \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \)
using the formula
\[ % :32:
  R_p \,=\, {{1 \over 1 / R_1 + 1 / R_2}.}   \]
Resistance values are usually known only up to some tolerance guaranteed by the
manufacturer of the resistor.  For example, if you buy a resistor labeled &ldquo;6.8
ohms with 10% tolerance&rdquo; you can only be sure that the resistor has a
resistance between 6.8 \( - \) 0.68 = 6.12 and 6.8 + 0.68 = 7.48 ohms.  Thus, if you
have a 6.8-ohm 10% resistor in parallel with a 4.7-ohm 5% resistor, the
resistance of the combination can range from about 2.58 ohms (if the two
resistors are at the lower bounds) to about 2.97 ohms (if the two resistors are
at the upper bounds).
</p>
<p>Alyssa&rsquo;s idea is to implement &ldquo;interval arithmetic&rdquo; as a set of arithmetic
operations for combining &ldquo;intervals&rdquo; (objects that represent the range of
possible values of an inexact quantity).  The result of adding, subtracting,
multiplying, or dividing two intervals is itself an interval, representing the
range of the result.
</p>
<p>Alyssa postulates the existence of an abstract object called an &ldquo;interval&rdquo;
that has two endpoints: a lower bound and an upper bound.  She also presumes
that, given the endpoints of an interval, she can construct the interval using
the data constructor <code>make-interval</code>.  Alyssa first writes a procedure for
adding two intervals.  She reasons that the minimum value the sum could be is
the sum of the two lower bounds and the maximum value it could be is the sum of
the two upper bounds:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (add-interval x y)
  (make-interval (+ (lower-bound x) 
                    (lower-bound y))
                 (+ (upper-bound x) 
                    (upper-bound y))))
</pre></div>

<p>Alyssa also works out the product of two intervals by finding the minimum and
the maximum of the products of the bounds and using them as the bounds of the
resulting interval.  (<code>Min</code> and <code>max</code> are primitives that find the
minimum or maximum of any number of arguments.)
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (mul-interval x y)
  (let ((p1 (* (lower-bound x) 
               (lower-bound y)))
        (p2 (* (lower-bound x) 
               (upper-bound y)))
        (p3 (* (upper-bound x) 
               (lower-bound y)))
        (p4 (* (upper-bound x) 
               (upper-bound y))))
    (make-interval (min p1 p2 p3 p4)
                   (max p1 p2 p3 p4))))
</pre></div>

<p>To divide two intervals, Alyssa multiplies the first by the reciprocal of the
second.  Note that the bounds of the reciprocal interval are the reciprocal of
the upper bound and the reciprocal of the lower bound, in that order.
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (div-interval x y)
  (mul-interval x 
                (make-interval 
                 (/ 1.0 (upper-bound y)) 
                 (/ 1.0 (lower-bound y)))))
</pre></div>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><span id="Exercise-2_002e7"></span>Exercise 2.7:</strong> Alyssa&rsquo;s program is incomplete
because she has not specified the implementation of the interval abstraction.
Here is a definition of the interval constructor:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (make-interval a b) (cons a b))
</pre></div>

<p>Define selectors <code>upper-bound</code> and <code>lower-bound</code> to complete the
implementation.
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><span id="Exercise-2_002e8"></span>Exercise 2.8:</strong> Using reasoning analogous to
Alyssa&rsquo;s, describe how the difference of two intervals may be computed.  Define
a corresponding subtraction procedure, called <code>sub-interval</code>.
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><span id="Exercise-2_002e9"></span>Exercise 2.9:</strong> The <span id="index-width"></span>
<em>width</em> of an interval
is half of the difference between its upper and lower bounds.  The width is a
measure of the uncertainty of the number specified by the interval.  For some
arithmetic operations the width of the result of combining two intervals is a
function only of the widths of the argument intervals, whereas for others the
width of the combination is not a function of the widths of the argument
intervals.  Show that the width of the sum (or difference) of two intervals is
a function only of the widths of the intervals being added (or subtracted).
Give examples to show that this is not true for multiplication or division.
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><span id="Exercise-2_002e10"></span>Exercise 2.10:</strong> Ben Bitdiddle, an expert systems
programmer, looks over Alyssa&rsquo;s shoulder and comments that it is not clear what
it means to divide by an interval that spans zero.  Modify Alyssa&rsquo;s code to
check for this condition and to signal an error if it occurs.
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><span id="Exercise-2_002e11"></span>Exercise 2.11:</strong> In passing, Ben also cryptically
comments: &ldquo;By testing the signs of the endpoints of the intervals, it is
possible to break <code>mul-interval</code> into nine cases, only one of which
requires more than two multiplications.&rdquo;  Rewrite this procedure using Ben&rsquo;s
suggestion.
</p>
<p>After debugging her program, Alyssa shows it to a potential user, who complains
that her program solves the wrong problem.  He wants a program that can deal
with numbers represented as a center value and an additive tolerance; for
example, he wants to work with intervals such as 3.5 \( \pm \) 0.15 rather than
[3.35, 3.65].  Alyssa returns to her desk and fixes this problem by supplying
an alternate constructor and alternate selectors:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (make-center-width c w)
  (make-interval (- c w) (+ c w)))

(define (center i)
  (/ (+ (lower-bound i) 
        (upper-bound i)) 
     2))

(define (width i)
  (/ (- (upper-bound i) 
        (lower-bound i)) 
     2))
</pre></div>

<p>Unfortunately, most of Alyssa&rsquo;s users are engineers.  Real engineering
situations usually involve measurements with only a small uncertainty, measured
as the ratio of the width of the interval to the midpoint of the interval.
Engineers usually specify percentage tolerances on the parameters of devices,
as in the resistor specifications given earlier.
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><span id="Exercise-2_002e12"></span>Exercise 2.12:</strong> Define a constructor
<code>make-center-percent</code> that takes a center and a percentage tolerance and
produces the desired interval.  You must also define a selector <code>percent</code>
that produces the percentage tolerance for a given interval.  The <code>center</code>
selector is the same as the one shown above.
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><span id="Exercise-2_002e13"></span>Exercise 2.13:</strong> Show that under the assumption of
small percentage tolerances there is a simple formula for the approximate
percentage tolerance of the product of two intervals in terms of the tolerances
of the factors.  You may simplify the problem by assuming that all numbers are
positive.
</p>
<p>After considerable work, Alyssa P. Hacker delivers her finished system.
Several years later, after she has forgotten all about it, she gets a frenzied
call from an irate user, Lem E. Tweakit.  It seems that Lem has noticed that
the formula for parallel resistors can be written in two algebraically
equivalent ways:
\[ % :33:
  {R_1 R_2 \over R_1 + R_2}  \]
and
\[ % :34:
  {{1 \over 1 / R_1 + 1 / R_2}.}  \]
He has written the following two programs, each of which computes the
parallel-resistors formula differently:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (par1 r1 r2)
  (div-interval 
   (mul-interval r1 r2)
   (add-interval r1 r2)))

(define (par2 r1 r2)
  (let ((one (make-interval 1 1)))
    (div-interval 
     one
     (add-interval 
      (div-interval one r1) 
      (div-interval one r2)))))
</pre></div>

<p>Lem complains that Alyssa&rsquo;s program gives different answers for the two ways of
computing. This is a serious complaint.
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><span id="Exercise-2_002e14"></span>Exercise 2.14:</strong> Demonstrate that Lem is right.
Investigate the behavior of the system on a variety of arithmetic
expressions. Make some intervals \( A \) and \( B \), and use them in computing the
expressions \( {A / A} \) and \( {A / B} \).  You will get the most insight by
using intervals whose width is a small percentage of the center value. Examine
the results of the computation in center-percent form (see <a href="#Exercise-2_002e12">Exercise 2.12</a>).
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><span id="Exercise-2_002e15"></span>Exercise 2.15:</strong> Eva Lu Ator, another user, has
also noticed the different intervals computed by different but algebraically
equivalent expressions. She says that a formula to compute with intervals using
Alyssa&rsquo;s system will produce tighter error bounds if it can be written in such
a form that no variable that represents an uncertain number is repeated.  Thus,
she says, <code>par2</code> is a &ldquo;better&rdquo; program for parallel resistances than
<code>par1</code>.  Is she right?  Why?
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><span id="Exercise-2_002e16"></span>Exercise 2.16:</strong> Explain, in general, why
equivalent algebraic expressions may lead to different answers.  Can you devise
an interval-arithmetic package that does not have this shortcoming, or is this
task impossible?  (Warning: This problem is very difficult.)

The name <code>cons</code> stands for
&ldquo;construct.&rdquo;  The names <code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code> derive from the original
implementation of Lisp on the IBM 704.  That machine had an addressing scheme
that allowed one to reference the &ldquo;address&rdquo; and &ldquo;decrement&rdquo; parts of a
memory location.  <code>Car</code> stands for &ldquo;Contents of Address part of
Register&rdquo; and <code>cdr</code> (pronounced &ldquo;could-er&rdquo;) stands for &ldquo;Contents of
Decrement part of Register.&rdquo;</p>

<div id="FOOT69"><p><a class="footnote_backlink" href="#DOCF69"><sup>69</sup></a>
Another way to define the selectors and
constructor is
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define make-rat cons)
(define numer car)
(define denom cdr)
</pre></div>

<p>The first definition associates the name <code>make-rat</code> with the value of the
expression <code>cons</code>, which is the primitive procedure that constructs pairs.
Thus <code>make-rat</code> and <code>cons</code> are names for the same primitive
constructor.
</p>
<p>Defining selectors and constructors in this way is efficient: Instead of
<code>make-rat</code> <em>calling</em> <code>cons</code>, <code>make-rat</code> <em>is</em>
<code>cons</code>, so there is only one procedure called, not two, when
<code>make-rat</code> is called.  On the other hand, doing this defeats debugging
aids that trace procedure calls or put breakpoints on procedure calls: You may
want to watch <code>make-rat</code> being called, but you certainly don&rsquo;t want to
watch every call to <code>cons</code>.
</p>
<p>We have chosen not to use this style of definition in this book.</p>

Surprisingly, this idea is very difficult to formulate
rigorously. There are two approaches to giving such a formulation.  One,
pioneered by C. A. R. <a href="References.html#Hoare-_00281972_0029">Hoare (1972)</a>, is known as the method of <span id="index-abstract-models"></span>
<em>abstract models</em>.  
It formalizes the &ldquo;procedures plus conditions&rdquo; specification as
outlined in the rational-number example above.  Note that the condition on the
rational-number representation was stated in terms of facts about integers
(equality and division).  In general, abstract models define new kinds of data
objects in terms of previously defined types of data objects.  Assertions about
data objects can therefore be checked by reducing them to assertions about
previously defined data objects.  Another approach, introduced by Zilles at
<abbr>MIT</abbr>, by Goguen, Thatcher, Wagner, and Wright at IBM 
(see <a href="References.html#Thatcher-et-al_002e-1978">Thatcher et al. 1978</a>), 
and by Guttag at Toronto (see <a href="References.html#Guttag-1977">Guttag 1977</a>), is called
<span id="index-algebraic-specification"></span>
<em>algebraic specification</em>.  It regards the &ldquo;procedures&rdquo; as elements
of an abstract algebraic system whose behavior is specified by axioms that
correspond to our &ldquo;conditions,&rdquo; and uses the techniques of abstract algebra
to check assertions about data objects.  Both methods are surveyed in the paper
by <a href="References.html#Liskov-and-Zilles-_00281975_0029">Liskov and Zilles (1975)</a>.</p>
