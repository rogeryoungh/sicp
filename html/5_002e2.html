<span id="A-Register_002dMachine-Simulator"></span><h3 class="section"><span class="secnum">5.2</span><span class="sectitle">A Register-Machine Simulator</span></h3>

<p>In order to gain a good understanding of the design of register machines, we
must test the machines we design to see if they perform as expected.  One way
to test a design is to hand-simulate the operation of the controller, as in
<a href="5_002e1.html#Exercise-5_002e5">Exercise 5.5</a>.  But this is extremely tedious for all but the simplest
machines.  In this section we construct a simulator for machines described in
the register-machine language.  The simulator is a Scheme program with four
interface procedures.  The first uses a description of a register machine to
construct a model of the machine (a data structure whose parts correspond to
the parts of the machine to be simulated), and the other three allow us to
simulate the machine by manipulating the model:
</p>
<blockquote>

<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(make-machine ⟨<var>register-names</var>⟩
              ⟨<var>operations</var>⟩
              ⟨<var>controller</var>⟩)
</pre></div>

<p>constructs and returns a model of the machine with the given registers,
operations, and controller.
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(set-register-contents! ⟨<var>machine-model</var>⟩ 
                        ⟨<var>register-name</var>⟩ 
                        ⟨<var>value</var>⟩)
</pre></div>

<p>stores a value in a simulated register in the given machine.
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(get-register-contents ⟨<var>machine-model</var>⟩
                       ⟨<var>register-name</var>⟩)
</pre></div>

<p>returns the contents of a simulated register in the given machine.
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(start ⟨<var>machine-model</var>⟩)
</pre></div>

<p>simulates the execution of the given machine, starting from the beginning of
the controller sequence and stopping when it reaches the end of the sequence.
</p></blockquote>

<p>As an example of how these procedures are used, we can define
<code>gcd-machine</code> to be a model of the <abbr>GCD</abbr> machine of 
<a href="5_002e1.html#g_t5_002e1_002e1">5.1.1</a> as follows:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define gcd-machine
  (make-machine
   '(a b t)
   (list (list 'rem remainder) (list '= =))
   '(test-b
       (test (op =) (reg b) (const 0))
       (branch (label gcd-done))
       (assign t (op rem) (reg a) (reg b))
       (assign a (reg b))
       (assign b (reg t))
       (goto (label test-b))
     gcd-done)))
</pre></div>

<p>The first argument to <code>make-machine</code> is a list of register names.  The
next argument is a table (a list of two-element lists) that pairs each
operation name with a Scheme procedure that implements the operation (that is,
produces the same output value given the same input values).  The last argument
specifies the controller as a list of labels and machine instructions, as in
<a href="5_002e1.html#g_t5_002e1">5.1</a>.
</p>
<p>To compute <abbr>GCD</abbr>s with this machine, we set the input registers, start
the machine, and examine the result when the simulation terminates:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(set-register-contents! gcd-machine 'a 206)
<i>done</i>

(set-register-contents! gcd-machine 'b 40)
<i>done</i>

(start gcd-machine)
<i>done</i>

(get-register-contents gcd-machine 'a)
<i>2</i>
</pre></div>

<p>This computation will run much more slowly than a <code>gcd</code> procedure written
in Scheme, because we will simulate low-level machine instructions, such as
<code>assign</code>, by much more complex operations.
</p>

<p><strong><span id="Exercise-5_002e7"></span>Exercise 5.7:</strong> Use the simulator to test the
machines you designed in <a href="5_002e1.html#Exercise-5_002e4">Exercise 5.4</a>.

<span id="g_t5_002e2_002e1"></span><span id="The-Machine-Model"></span><h4 class="subsection"><span class="secnum">5.2.1</span><span class="sectitle">The Machine Model</span></h4>

<p>The machine model generated by <code>make-machine</code> is represented as a
procedure with local state using the message-passing techniques developed in
<a href="Chapter-3.html">Chapter 3</a>.  To build this model, <code>make-machine</code> begins by calling
the procedure <code>make-new-machine</code> to construct the parts of the machine
model that are common to all register machines.  This basic machine model
constructed by <code>make-new-machine</code> is essentially a container for some
registers and a stack, together with an execution mechanism that processes the
controller instructions one by one.
</p>
<p><code>Make-machine</code> then extends this basic model (by sending it messages) to
include the registers, operations, and controller of the particular machine
being defined.  First it allocates a register in the new machine for each of
the supplied register names and installs the designated operations in the
machine.  Then it uses an <span id="index-assembler"></span>
<em>assembler</em> (described below in 
<a href="#g_t5_002e2_002e2">5.2.2</a>) to transform the controller list into instructions for the new
machine and installs these as the machine&rsquo;s instruction sequence.
<code>Make-machine</code> returns as its value the modified machine model.
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (make-machine register-names 
                      ops 
                      controller-text)
  (let ((machine (make-new-machine)))
    (for-each (lambda (register-name)
                ((machine 'allocate-register) 
                 register-name))
              register-names)

    machine))
</pre></div>

<span id="Registers"></span><h4 class="subsubheading">Registers</h4>

<p>We will represent a register as a procedure with local state, as in
<a href="Chapter-3.html">Chapter 3</a>.  The procedure <code>make-register</code> creates a register that
holds a value that can be accessed or changed:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (make-register name)
  (let ((contents '*unassigned*))
    (define (dispatch message)
      (cond ((eq? message 'get) contents)
            ((eq? message 'set)
             (lambda (value) 
               (set! contents value)))
            (else
             (error &quot;Unknown request: 
                     REGISTER&quot;
                    message))))
    dispatch))
</pre></div>

<p>The following procedures are used to access registers:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (get-contents register)
  (register 'get))

(define (set-contents! register value)
  ((register 'set) value))
</pre></div>

<span id="The-stack"></span><h4 class="subsubheading">The stack</h4>

<p>We can also represent a stack as a procedure with local state.  The procedure
<code>make-stack</code> creates a stack whose local state consists of a list of the
items on the stack.  A stack accepts requests to <code>push</code> an item onto the
stack, to <code>pop</code> the top item off the stack and return it, and to
<code>initialize</code> the stack to empty.
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (make-stack)
  (let ((s '()))
    (define (push x)
      (set! s (cons x s)))
    (define (pop)
      (if (null? s)
          (error &quot;Empty stack: POP&quot;)
          (let ((top (car s)))
            (set! s (cdr s))
            top)))
    (define (initialize)
      (set! s '())
      'done)
    (define (dispatch message)
      (cond ((eq? message 'push) push)
            ((eq? message 'pop) (pop))
            ((eq? message 'initialize) 
             (initialize))
            (else 
             (error &quot;Unknown request: STACK&quot;
                    message))))
    dispatch))

<p>The following procedures are used to access stacks:

<p>The <code>make-new-machine</code> procedure, shown in <a href="#Figure-5_002e13">Figure&nbsp;5.13<!-- /@w --></a>,

sequence, a list of operations that initially contains an operation to

<p>The <code>flag</code> register is used to control branching in the simulated machine.
<code>Test</code> instructions set the contents of <code>flag</code> to the result of the
test (true or false).  <code>Branch</code> instructions decide whether or not to
branch by examining the contents of <code>flag</code>.
</p>
<p>The <code>pc</code> register determines the sequencing of instructions as the machine
runs.  This sequencing is implemented by the internal procedure <code>execute</code>.
In the simulation model, each machine instruction is a data structure that
includes a procedure of no arguments, called the <span id="index-instruction-execution-procedure"></span>
<em>instruction execution procedure</em>, 
such that calling this procedure simulates executing the
instruction.  As the simulation runs, <code>pc</code> points to the place in the
instruction sequence beginning with the next instruction to be executed.
<code>Execute</code> gets that instruction, executes it by calling the instruction
execution procedure, and repeats this cycle until there are no more
instructions to execute (i.e., until <code>pc</code> points to the end of the
instruction sequence).
</p>
<p>As part of its operation, each instruction execution procedure modifies
<code>pc</code> to indicate the next instruction to be executed.  <code>Branch</code> and
<code>goto</code> instructions change <code>pc</code> to point to the new destination.  All
other instructions simply advance <code>pc</code>, making it point to the next
instruction in the sequence.  Observe that each call to <code>execute</code> calls
<code>execute</code> again, but this does not produce an infinite loop because
running the instruction execution procedure changes the contents of <code>pc</code>.
</p>
<p><code>Make-new-machine</code> returns a <code>dispatch</code> procedure that implements
message-passing access to the internal state.  Notice that starting the machine
is accomplished by setting <code>pc</code> to the beginning of the instruction
sequence and calling <code>execute</code>.
</p>
<p>For convenience, we provide an alternate procedural interface to a machine&rsquo;s
<code>start</code> operation, as well as procedures to set and examine register
contents, as specified at the beginning of <a href="#g_t5_002e2">5.2</a>:

<span id="g_t5_002e2_002e2"></span><span id="The-Assembler"></span><h4 class="subsection"><span class="secnum">5.2.2</span><span class="sectitle">The Assembler</span></h4>

<p>The assembler transforms the sequence of controller expressions for a machine
into a corresponding list of machine instructions, each with its execution
procedure.  Overall, the assembler is much like the evaluators we studied in
<a href="Chapter-4.html">Chapter 4</a>&mdash;there is an input language (in this case, the
register-machine language) and we must perform an appropriate action for each
type of expression in the language.
</p>
<p>The technique of producing an execution procedure for each instruction is just
what we used in <a href="4_002e1.html#g_t4_002e1_002e7">4.1.7</a> to speed up the evaluator by separating
analysis from runtime execution.  As we saw in <a href="Chapter-4.html">Chapter 4</a>, much useful
analysis of Scheme expressions could be performed without knowing the actual
values of variables.  Here, analogously, much useful analysis of
register-machine-language expressions can be performed without knowing the
actual contents of machine registers.  For example, we can replace references
to registers by pointers to the register objects, and we can replace references
to labels by pointers to the place in the instruction sequence that the label
designates.
</p>
<p>Before it can generate the instruction execution procedures, the assembler must
know what all the labels refer to, so it begins by scanning the controller text
to separate the labels from the instructions.  As it scans the text, it
constructs both a list of instructions and a table that associates each label
with a pointer into that list.  Then the assembler augments the instruction
list by inserting the execution procedure for each instruction.
</p>
<p>The <code>assemble</code> procedure is the main entry to the assembler.  It takes the
controller text and the machine model as arguments and returns the instruction
sequence to be stored in the model.  <code>Assemble</code> calls
<code>extract-labels</code> to build the initial instruction list and label table
from the supplied controller text.  The second argument to
<code>extract-labels</code> is a procedure to be called to process these results:
This procedure uses <code>update-insts!</code> to generate the instruction execution
procedures and insert them into the instruction list, and returns the modified
list.
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (assemble controller-text machine)
  (extract-labels controller-text
    (lambda (insts labels)
      (update-insts! insts labels machine)
      insts)))
</pre></div>

<p><code>Extract-labels</code> takes as arguments a list <code>text</code> (the sequence of
controller instruction expressions) and a <code>receive</code> procedure.
<code>Receive</code> will be called with two values: (1) a list <code>insts</code> of
instruction data structures, each containing an instruction from <code>text</code>;
and (2) a table called <code>labels</code>, which associates each label from
<code>text</code> with the position in the list <code>insts</code> that the label
designates.
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (extract-labels text receive)
  (if (null? text)
      (receive '() '())
      (extract-labels 
       (cdr text)
       (lambda (insts labels)
         (let ((next-inst (car text)))
           (if (symbol? next-inst)
               (receive 
                   insts
                   (cons 
                    (make-label-entry 
                     next-inst
                     insts)
                    labels))
               (receive 
                   (cons (make-instruction 
                          next-inst)
                         insts)
                   labels)))))))
</pre></div>

<p><code>Extract-labels</code> works by sequentially scanning the elements of the
<code>text</code> and accumulating the <code>insts</code> and the <code>labels</code>.  If an
element is a symbol (and thus a label) an appropriate entry is added to the
<code>labels</code> table.  Otherwise the element is accumulated onto the
<code>insts</code> list.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF289" href="#FOOT289"><sup>289</sup></a>
</p>
<p><code>Update-insts!</code> modifies the instruction list, which initially contains
only the text of the instructions, to include the corresponding execution
procedures:

<p>For each type of instruction in the register-machine language, there is a
generator that builds an appropriate execution procedure.  The details of these
procedures determine both the syntax and meaning of the individual instructions
in the register-machine language.  We use data abstraction to isolate the
detailed syntax of register-machine expressions from the general execution
mechanism, as we did for evaluators in <a href="4_002e1.html#g_t4_002e1_002e2">4.1.2</a>, by using syntax
procedures to extract and classify the parts of an instruction.

<span id="Assign-instructions"></span><h4 class="subsubheading"><code>Assign</code> instructions</h4>

<p>The <code>make-assign</code> procedure handles <code>assign</code> instructions:

        (advance-pc pc)))))
</pre></div>

<p><code>Make-assign</code> extracts the target register name (the second element of the
instruction) and the value expression (the rest of the list that forms the
instruction) from the <code>assign</code> instruction using the selectors
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (assign-reg-name assign-instruction)
  (cadr assign-instruction))
(define (assign-value-exp assign-instruction)
  (cddr assign-instruction))
</pre></div>

<p>The register name is looked up with <code>get-register</code> to produce the target
register object.  The value expression is passed to <code>make-operation-exp</code>
if the value is the result of an operation, and to <code>make-primitive-exp</code>
otherwise.  These procedures (shown below) parse the value expression and
produce an execution procedure for the value.  This is a procedure of no
arguments, called <code>value-proc</code>, which will be evaluated during the
simulation to produce the actual value to be assigned to the register.  Notice
that the work of looking up the register name and parsing the value expression
is performed just once, at assembly time, not every time the instruction is
simulated.  This saving of work is the reason we use execution procedures, and
corresponds directly to the saving in work we obtained by separating program
analysis from execution in the evaluator of <a href="4_002e1.html#g_t4_002e1_002e7">4.1.7</a>.
</p>
<p>The result returned by <code>make-assign</code> is the execution procedure for the
<code>assign</code> instruction.  When this procedure is called (by the machine
model&rsquo;s <code>execute</code> procedure), it sets the contents of the target register
to the result obtained by executing <code>value-proc</code>.  Then it advances the
<code>pc</code> to the next instruction by running the procedure

<p><code>Make-test</code> handles <code>test</code> instructions in a similar way.  It
extracts the expression that specifies the condition to be tested and generates
an execution procedure for it.  At simulation time, the procedure for the
condition is called, the result is assigned to the <code>flag</code> register, and
the <code>pc</code> is advanced:

<p>The execution procedure for a <code>branch</code> instruction checks the contents of
the <code>flag</code> register and either sets the contents of the <code>pc</code> to the
branch destination (if the branch is taken) or else just advances the <code>pc</code>
(if the branch is not taken).  Notice that the indicated destination in a
<code>branch</code> instruction must be a label, and the <code>make-branch</code> procedure
enforces this.  Notice also that the label is looked up at assembly time, not
each time the <code>branch</code> instruction is simulated.

<p><a href="#Exercise-5_002e15">Exercise 5.15</a> through <a href="#Exercise-5_002e19">Exercise 5.19</a> describe other useful
monitoring and debugging features that can be added to the register-machine
simulator.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><span id="Exercise-5_002e14"></span>Exercise 5.14:</strong> Measure the number of pushes and
the maximum stack depth required to compute \( {n!} \) for various small values of
\( n \) using the factorial machine shown in <a href="5_002e1.html#Figure-5_002e11">Figure 5.11</a>.  From your data
determine formulas in terms of \( n \) for the total number of push operations
and the maximum stack depth used in computing \( {n!} \) for any \( {n &gt; 1} \). Note
that each of these is a linear function of \( n \) and is thus determined by two
constants.  In order to get the statistics printed, you will have to augment
the factorial machine with instructions to initialize the stack and print the
statistics.  You may want to also modify the machine so that it repeatedly
reads a value for \( n \), computes the factorial, and prints the result (as we
did for the <abbr>GCD</abbr> machine in <a href="5_002e1.html#Figure-5_002e4">Figure 5.4</a>), so that you will not
have to repeatedly invoke <code>get-register-contents</code>,
<code>set-register-contents!</code>, and <code>start</code>.
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><span id="Exercise-5_002e15"></span>Exercise 5.15:</strong> Add <span id="index-instruction-counting"></span>
<em>instruction counting</em> 
to the register machine simulation.  That is, have the machine model
keep track of the number of instructions executed.  Extend the machine model&rsquo;s
interface to accept a new message that prints the value of the instruction
count and resets the count to zero.
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><span id="Exercise-5_002e16"></span>Exercise 5.16:</strong> Augment the simulator to provide
for <span id="index-instruction-tracing"></span>
<em>instruction tracing</em>.  That is, before each instruction is
executed, the simulator should print the text of the instruction.  Make the
machine model accept <code>trace-on</code> and <code>trace-off</code> messages to turn
tracing on and off.
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><span id="Exercise-5_002e17"></span>Exercise 5.17:</strong> Extend the instruction tracing of
<a href="#Exercise-5_002e16">Exercise 5.16</a> so that before printing an instruction, the simulator
prints any labels that immediately precede that instruction in the controller
sequence.  Be careful to do this in a way that does not interfere with
instruction counting (<a href="#Exercise-5_002e15">Exercise 5.15</a>).  You will have to make the
simulator retain the necessary label information.
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><span id="Exercise-5_002e18"></span>Exercise 5.18:</strong> Modify the <code>make-register</code>
procedure of <a href="#g_t5_002e2_002e1">5.2.1</a> so that registers can be traced.  Registers
should accept messages that turn tracing on and off.  When a register is
traced, assigning a value to the register should print the name of the
register, the old contents of the register, and the new contents being
assigned.  Extend the interface to the machine model to permit you to turn
tracing on and off for designated machine registers.
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><span id="Exercise-5_002e19"></span>Exercise 5.19:</strong> Alyssa P. Hacker wants a
<span id="index-breakpoint"></span>
<em>breakpoint</em> feature in the simulator to help her debug her machine
designs.  You have been hired to install this feature for her.  She wants to be
able to specify a place in the controller sequence where the simulator will
stop and allow her to examine the state of the machine.  You are to implement a
procedure
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(set-breakpoint ⟨<var>machine</var>⟩ ⟨<var>label</var>⟩ ⟨<var>n</var>⟩)
</pre></div>

<p>that sets a breakpoint just before the \( n^{\text{th}} \) instruction after the given
label.  For example,
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(set-breakpoint gcd-machine 'test-b 4)
</pre></div>

<p>installs a breakpoint in <code>gcd-machine</code> just before the assignment to
register <code>a</code>.  When the simulator reaches the breakpoint it should print
the label and the offset of the breakpoint and stop executing instructions.
Alyssa can then use <code>get-register-contents</code> and
<code>set-register-contents!</code> to manipulate the state of the simulated machine.
She should then be able to continue execution by saying
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(proceed-machine ⟨<var>machine</var>⟩)
</pre></div>

<p>She should also be able to remove a specific breakpoint by means of
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(cancel-breakpoint ⟨<var>machine</var>⟩ ⟨<var>label</var>⟩ ⟨<var>n</var>⟩)
</pre></div>

<p>or to remove all breakpoints by means of
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(cancel-all-breakpoints ⟨<var>machine</var>⟩)

Using the <code>receive</code> procedure here is a way to
get <code>extract-labels</code> to effectively return two values&mdash;<code>labels</code> and
<code>insts</code>&mdash;without explicitly making a compound data structure to hold
them.  An alternative implementation, which returns an explicit pair of values,
is
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (extract-labels text)
  (if (null? text)
      (cons '() '())
      (let ((result 
             (extract-labels (cdr text))))
        (let ((insts (car result))
              (labels (cdr result)))
          (let ((next-inst (car text)))
            (if (symbol? next-inst)
                (cons 
                 insts
                 (cons 
                  (make-label-entry 
                   next-inst insts) 
                  labels))
                (cons 
                 (cons 
                  (make-instruction next-inst) 
                  insts)
                 labels)))))))
</pre></div>

<p>which would be called by <code>assemble</code> as follows:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (assemble controller-text machine)
  (let ((result 
         (extract-labels controller-text)))
    (let ((insts (car result))
          (labels (cdr result)))
      (update-insts! insts labels machine)
      insts)))
</pre></div>

<p>You can consider our use of <code>receive</code> as demonstrating an elegant way to
return multiple values, or simply an excuse to show off a programming trick.
An argument like <code>receive</code> that is the next procedure to be invoked is
called a &ldquo;continuation.&rdquo;  Recall that we also used continuations to implement
the backtracking control structure in the <code>amb</code> evaluator in
