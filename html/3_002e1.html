<span id="Assignment-and-Local-State"></span><h3 class="section"><span class="secnum">3.1</span><span class="sectitle">Assignment and Local State</span></h3>

<p>We ordinarily view the world as populated by independent objects, each of which
has a state that changes over time.  An object is said to &ldquo;have state&rdquo; if its
behavior is influenced by its history.  A bank account, for example, has state
in that the answer to the question &ldquo;Can I withdraw $100?&rdquo;  depends upon the
history of deposit and withdrawal transactions.  We can characterize an
object&rsquo;s state by one or more <span id="index-state-variables-1"></span>
<em>state variables</em>, which among them
maintain enough information about history to determine the object&rsquo;s current
behavior.  In a simple banking system, we could characterize the state of an
account by a current balance rather than by remembering the entire history of
account transactions.
</p>
<p>In a system composed of many objects, the objects are rarely completely
independent.  Each may influence the states of others through interactions,
which serve to couple the state variables of one object to those of other
objects.  Indeed, the view that a system is composed of separate objects is
most useful when the state variables of the system can be grouped into closely
coupled subsystems that are only loosely coupled to other subsystems.
</p>
<p>This view of a system can be a powerful framework for organizing computational
models of the system.  For such a model to be modular, it should be decomposed
into computational objects that model the actual objects in the system.  Each
computational object must have its own <span id="index-local-state-variables"></span>
<em>local state variables</em>
describing the actual object&rsquo;s state.  Since the states of objects in the
system being modeled change over time, the state variables of the corresponding
computational objects must also change.  If we choose to model the flow of time
in the system by the elapsed time in the computer, then we must have a way to
construct computational objects whose behaviors change as our programs run.  In
particular, if we wish to model state variables by ordinary symbolic names in
the programming language, then the language must provide an <span id="index-assignment-operator"></span>
<em>assignment operator</em> 
to enable us to change the value associated with a name.
</p>

<span id="g_t3_002e1_002e1"></span><span id="Local-State-Variables"></span><h4 class="subsection"><span class="secnum">3.1.1</span><span class="sectitle">Local State Variables</span></h4>

<p>To illustrate what we mean by having a computational object with time-varying
state, let us model the situation of withdrawing money from a bank account.  We
will do this using a procedure <code>withdraw</code>, which takes as argument an
<code>amount</code> to be withdrawn.  If there is enough money in the account to
accommodate the withdrawal, then <code>withdraw</code> should return the balance
remaining after the withdrawal.  Otherwise, <code>withdraw</code> should return the
message <em>Insufficient funds</em>. For example, if we begin with $100 in the
account, we should obtain the following sequence of responses using
<code>withdraw</code>:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(withdraw 25)
<i>75</i>

(withdraw 25)
<i>50</i>

(withdraw 60)
<i>&quot;Insufficient funds&quot;</i>

(withdraw 15)
<i>35</i>
</pre></div>

<p>Observe that the expression <code>(withdraw 25)</code>, evaluated twice, yields
different values.  This is a new kind of behavior for a procedure.  Until now,
all our procedures could be viewed as specifications for computing mathematical
functions.  A call to a procedure computed the value of the function applied to
the given arguments, and two calls to the same procedure with the same
arguments always produced the same result.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF129" href="#FOOT129"><sup>129</sup></a>
</p>
<p>To implement <code>withdraw</code>, we can use a variable <code>balance</code> to indicate
the balance of money in the account and define <code>withdraw</code> as a procedure
that accesses <code>balance</code>.  The <code>withdraw</code> procedure checks to see if
<code>balance</code> is at least as large as the requested <code>amount</code>.  If so,
<code>withdraw</code> decrements <code>balance</code> by <code>amount</code> and returns the new
value of <code>balance</code>.  Otherwise, <code>withdraw</code> returns the
<em>Insufficient funds</em> message.  Here are the definitions of <code>balance</code>
and <code>withdraw</code>:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define balance 100)

(define (withdraw amount)
  (if (&gt;= balance amount)
      (begin (set! balance (- balance amount))
             balance)
      &quot;Insufficient funds&quot;))
</pre></div>

<p>Decrementing <code>balance</code> is accomplished by the expression
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(set! balance (- balance amount))
</pre></div>

<p>This uses the <code>set!</code> special form, whose syntax is
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(set! ⟨<var>name</var>⟩ ⟨<var>new-value</var>⟩)
</pre></div>

<p>Here <code>⟨</code><var>name</var><code>⟩</code> is a symbol and <code>⟨</code><var>new-value</var><code>⟩</code> is any expression.
<code>Set!</code> changes <code>⟨</code><var>name</var><code>⟩</code> so that its value is the result obtained by
evaluating <code>⟨</code><var>new-value</var><code>⟩</code>.  In the case at hand, we are changing
<code>balance</code> so that its new value will be the result of subtracting
<code>amount</code> from the previous value of <code>balance</code>.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF130" href="#FOOT130"><sup>130</sup></a>
</p>
<p><code>Withdraw</code> also uses the <code>begin</code> special form to cause two
expressions to be evaluated in the case where the <code>if</code> test is true: first
decrementing <code>balance</code> and then returning the value of <code>balance</code>.  In
general, evaluating the expression
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(begin ⟨<var>exp₁</var>⟩ ⟨<var>exp₂</var>⟩ <span class="roman">…</span> ⟨<var>expₖ</var>⟩)
</pre></div>

<p>causes the expressions \( {⟨exp_1⟩} \) through \( {⟨exp_k⟩} \) to be evaluated
in sequence and the value of the final expression \( {⟨exp_k⟩} \) to be
returned as the value of the entire <code>begin</code> form.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF131" href="#FOOT131"><sup>131</sup></a>
</p>
<p>Although <code>withdraw</code> works as desired, the variable <code>balance</code> presents
a problem.  As specified above, <code>balance</code> is a name defined in the global
environment and is freely accessible to be examined or modified by any
procedure.  It would be much better if we could somehow make <code>balance</code>
internal to <code>withdraw</code>, so that <code>withdraw</code> would be the only
procedure that could access <code>balance</code> directly and any other procedure
could access <code>balance</code> only indirectly (through calls to <code>withdraw</code>).
This would more accurately model the notion that <code>balance</code> is a local
state variable used by <code>withdraw</code> to keep track of the state of the
account.
</p>
<p>We can make <code>balance</code> internal to <code>withdraw</code> by rewriting the
definition as follows:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define new-withdraw
  (let ((balance 100))
    (lambda (amount)
      (if (&gt;= balance amount)
          (begin (set! balance 
                       (- balance amount))
                 balance)
          &quot;Insufficient funds&quot;))))
</pre></div>

<p>What we have done here is use <code>let</code> to establish an environment with a
local variable <code>balance</code>, bound to the initial value 100.  Within this
local environment, we use <code>lambda</code> to create a procedure that takes
<code>amount</code> as an argument and behaves like our previous <code>withdraw</code>
procedure.  This procedure&mdash;returned as the result of evaluating the
<code>let</code> expression&mdash;is <code>new-withdraw</code>, which behaves in precisely the
same way as <code>withdraw</code> but whose variable <code>balance</code> is not accessible
by any other procedure.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF132" href="#FOOT132"><sup>132</sup></a>
</p>
<p>Combining <code>set!</code> with local variables is the general programming technique
we will use for constructing computational objects with local state.
Unfortunately, using this technique raises a serious problem: When we first
introduced procedures, we also introduced the substitution model of evaluation
(<a href="1_002e1.html#g_t1_002e1_002e5">1.1.5</a>) to provide an interpretation of what procedure
application means.  We said that applying a procedure should be interpreted as
evaluating the body of the procedure with the formal parameters replaced by
their values.  The trouble is that, as soon as we introduce assignment into our
language, substitution is no longer an adequate model of procedure application.
(We will see why this is so in <a href="#g_t3_002e1_002e3">3.1.3</a>.)  As a consequence, we
technically have at this point no way to understand why the <code>new-withdraw</code>
procedure behaves as claimed above.  In order to really understand a procedure
such as <code>new-withdraw</code>, we will need to develop a new model of procedure
application.  In <a href="3_002e2.html#g_t3_002e2">3.2</a> we will introduce such a model, together
with an explanation of <code>set!</code> and local variables.  First, however, we
examine some variations on the theme established by <code>new-withdraw</code>.
</p>
<p>The following procedure, <code>make-withdraw</code>, creates &ldquo;withdrawal
processors.&rdquo;  The formal parameter <code>balance</code> in <code>make-withdraw</code>
specifies the initial amount of money in the account.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF133" href="#FOOT133"><sup>133</sup></a>
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (make-withdraw balance)
  (lambda (amount)
    (if (&gt;= balance amount)
        (begin (set! balance 
                     (- balance amount))
               balance)
        &quot;Insufficient funds&quot;)))
</pre></div>

<p><code>Make-withdraw</code> can be used as follows to create two objects <code>W1</code> and
<code>W2</code>:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define W1 (make-withdraw 100))
(define W2 (make-withdraw 100))

(W1 50)
<i>50</i>

(W2 70)
<i>30</i>

(W2 40)
<i>&quot;Insufficient funds&quot;</i>

(W1 40)
<i>10</i>
</pre></div>

<p>Observe that <code>W1</code> and <code>W2</code> are completely independent objects, each
with its own local state variable <code>balance</code>.  Withdrawals from one do not
affect the other.
</p>
<p>We can also create objects that handle deposits as well as withdrawals, and
thus we can represent simple bank accounts.  Here is a procedure that returns a
&ldquo;bank-account object&rdquo; with a specified initial balance:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (make-account balance)
  (define (withdraw amount)
    (if (&gt;= balance amount)
        (begin (set! balance 
                     (- balance amount))
               balance)
        &quot;Insufficient funds&quot;))
  (define (deposit amount)
    (set! balance (+ balance amount))
    balance)
  (define (dispatch m)
    (cond ((eq? m 'withdraw) withdraw)
          ((eq? m 'deposit) deposit)
          (else (error &quot;Unknown request: 
                 MAKE-ACCOUNT&quot; m))))
  dispatch)
</pre></div>

<p>Each call to <code>make-account</code> sets up an environment with a local state
variable <code>balance</code>.  Within this environment, <code>make-account</code> defines
procedures <code>deposit</code> and <code>withdraw</code> that access <code>balance</code> and an
additional procedure <code>dispatch</code> that takes a &ldquo;message&rdquo; as input and
returns one of the two local procedures.  The <code>dispatch</code> procedure itself
is returned as the value that represents the bank-account object.  This is
precisely the <span id="index-message_002dpassing"></span>
<em>message-passing</em> style of programming that we saw in
<a href="2_002e4.html#g_t2_002e4_002e3">2.4.3</a>, although here we are using it in conjunction with the
ability to modify local variables.
</p>
<p><code>Make-account</code> can be used as follows:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define acc (make-account 100))

((acc 'withdraw) 50)
<i>50</i>

((acc 'withdraw) 60)
<i>&quot;Insufficient funds&quot;</i>

((acc 'deposit) 40)
<i>90</i>

((acc 'withdraw) 60)
<i>30</i>
</pre></div>

<p>Each call to <code>acc</code> returns the locally defined <code>deposit</code> or
<code>withdraw</code> procedure, which is then applied to the specified
<code>amount</code>.  As was the case with <code>make-withdraw</code>, another call to
<code>make-account</code>
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define acc2 (make-account 100))
</pre></div>

<p>will produce a completely separate account object, which maintains its own
local <code>balance</code>.

<p>As we shall see, introducing assignment into our programming language leads us
into a thicket of difficult conceptual issues.  Nevertheless, viewing systems
as collections of objects with local state is a powerful technique for
maintaining a modular design.  As a simple example, consider the design of a
procedure <code>rand</code> that, whenever it is called, returns an integer chosen at
random.
</p>
<p>It is not at all clear what is meant by &ldquo;chosen at random.&rdquo;  What we
presumably want is for successive calls to <code>rand</code> to produce a sequence of
numbers that has statistical properties of uniform distribution.  We will not
discuss methods for generating suitable sequences here.  Rather, let us assume
that we have a procedure <code>rand-update</code> that has the property that if we
start with a given number \( x_1 \) and form
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp"><var>x₂</var> = (rand-update <var>x₁</var>)
<var>x₃</var> = (rand-update <var>x₂</var>)
</pre></div>

<p>then the sequence of values \( x_1 \), \( x_2 \), \( x_3 \), &hellip; will have the
desired statistical properties.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF134" href="#FOOT134"><sup>134</sup></a>
</p>
<p>We can implement <code>rand</code> as a procedure with a local state variable
<code>x</code> that is initialized to some fixed value <code>random-init</code>.  Each call
to <code>rand</code> computes <code>rand-update</code> of the current value of <code>x</code>,
returns this as the random number, and also stores this as the new value of
<code>x</code>.
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define rand
  (let ((x random-init))
    (lambda () (set! x (rand-update x)) x)))
</pre></div>

<p>Of course, we could generate the same sequence of random numbers without using
assignment by simply calling <code>rand-update</code> directly.  However, this would
mean that any part of our program that used random numbers would have to
explicitly remember the current value of <code>x</code> to be passed as an argument
to <code>rand-update</code>.  To realize what an annoyance this would be, consider
using random numbers to implement a technique called <span id="index-Monte-Carlo-simulation"></span>
<em>Monte Carlo simulation</em>.
</p>
<p>The Monte Carlo method consists of choosing sample experiments at random from a
large set and then making deductions on the basis of the probabilities
estimated from tabulating the results of those experiments.  For example, we
can approximate \( \pi \) using the fact that \( {6/\pi^2} \) is the probability
that two integers chosen at random will have no factors in common; that is,
that their greatest common divisor will be 1.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF135" href="#FOOT135"><sup>135</sup></a> To
obtain the approximation to \( \pi \), we perform a large number of experiments.
In each experiment we choose two integers at random and perform a test to see
if their <abbr>GCD</abbr> is 1.  The fraction of times that the test is passed
gives us our estimate of \( {6/\pi^2} \), and from this we obtain our
approximation to \( \pi \).
</p>
<p>The heart of our program is a procedure <code>monte-carlo</code>, which takes as
arguments the number of times to try an experiment, together with the
experiment, represented as a no-argument procedure that will return either true
or false each time it is run.  <code>Monte-carlo</code> runs the experiment for the
designated number of trials and returns a number telling the fraction of the
trials in which the experiment was found to be true.
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (estimate-pi trials)
  (sqrt (/ 6 (monte-carlo trials 
                          cesaro-test))))
(define (cesaro-test)
   (= (gcd (rand) (rand)) 1))

(define (monte-carlo trials experiment)
  (define (iter trials-remaining trials-passed)
    (cond ((= trials-remaining 0)
           (/ trials-passed trials))
          ((experiment)
           (iter (- trials-remaining 1) 
                 (+ trials-passed 1)))
          (else
           (iter (- trials-remaining 1) 
                 trials-passed))))
  (iter trials 0))
</pre></div>

<p>Now let us try the same computation using <code>rand-update</code> directly rather
than <code>rand</code>, the way we would be forced to proceed if we did not use
assignment to model local state:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (estimate-pi trials)
  (sqrt (/ 6 (random-gcd-test trials 
                              random-init))))

(define (random-gcd-test trials initial-x)
  (define (iter trials-remaining 
                trials-passed 
                x)
    (let ((x1 (rand-update x)))
      (let ((x2 (rand-update x1)))
        (cond ((= trials-remaining 0)
               (/ trials-passed trials))
              ((= (gcd x1 x2) 1)
               (iter (- trials-remaining 1)
                     (+ trials-passed 1)
                     x2))
              (else
               (iter (- trials-remaining 1)
                     trials-passed
                     x2))))))
  (iter trials 0 initial-x))
</pre></div>

<p>While the program is still simple, it betrays some painful breaches of
modularity.  In our first version of the program, using <code>rand</code>, we can
express the Monte Carlo method directly as a general <code>monte-carlo</code>
procedure that takes as an argument an arbitrary <code>experiment</code> procedure.
In our second version of the program, with no local state for the random-number
generator, <code>random-gcd-test</code> must explicitly manipulate the random numbers
<code>x1</code> and <code>x2</code> and recycle <code>x2</code> through the iterative loop as the
new input to <code>rand-update</code>.  This explicit handling of the random numbers
intertwines the structure of accumulating test results with the fact that our
particular experiment uses two random numbers, whereas other Monte Carlo
experiments might use one random number or three.  Even the top-level procedure
<code>estimate-pi</code> has to be concerned with supplying an initial random number.
The fact that the random-number generator&rsquo;s insides are leaking out into other
parts of the program makes it difficult for us to isolate the Monte Carlo idea
so that it can be applied to other tasks.  In the first version of the program,
assignment encapsulates the state of the random-number generator within the
<code>rand</code> procedure, so that the details of random-number generation remain
independent of the rest of the program.
</p>
<p>The general phenomenon illustrated by the Monte Carlo example is this: From the
point of view of one part of a complex process, the other parts appear to
change with time.  They have hidden time-varying local state.  If we wish to
write computer programs whose structure reflects this decomposition, we make
computational objects (such as bank accounts and random-number generators)
whose behavior changes with time.  We model state with local state variables,
and we model the changes of state with assignments to those variables.
</p>
<p>It is tempting to conclude this discussion by saying that, by introducing
assignment and the technique of hiding state in local variables, we are able to
structure systems in a more modular fashion than if all state had to be
manipulated explicitly, by passing additional parameters.  Unfortunately, as we
shall see, the story is not so simple.

<p><strong><span id="Exercise-3_002e5"></span>Exercise 3.5:</strong> <span id="index-Monte-Carlo-integration"></span>
<em>Monte Carlo integration</em>
is a method of estimating definite integrals by means of Monte Carlo
simulation.  Consider computing the area of a region of space described by a
predicate \( {P(x, y)} \) that is true for points \( {(x, y)} \) in the
region and false for points not in the region.  For example, the region
contained within a circle of radius 3 centered at (5, 7) is described by the
predicate that tests whether \( {(x - 5)^2} + {(y - 7)^2 \le 3^2} \).  To estimate
the area of the region described by such a predicate, begin by choosing a
rectangle that contains the region.  For example, a rectangle with diagonally
opposite corners at (2, 4) and (8, 10) contains the circle above.  The desired
integral is the area of that portion of the rectangle that lies in the region.
We can estimate the integral by picking, at random, points \( {(x, y)} \) that
lie in the rectangle, and testing \( {P(x, y)} \) for each point to
determine whether the point lies in the region.  If we try this with many
points, then the fraction of points that fall in the region should give an
estimate of the proportion of the rectangle that lies in the region.  Hence,
multiplying this fraction by the area of the entire rectangle should produce an
estimate of the integral.
</p>
<p>Implement Monte Carlo integration as a procedure <code>estimate-integral</code> that
takes as arguments a predicate <code>P</code>, upper and lower bounds <code>x1</code>,
<code>x2</code>, <code>y1</code>, and <code>y2</code> for the rectangle, and the number of trials
to perform in order to produce the estimate.  Your procedure should use the
same <code>monte-carlo</code> procedure that was used above to estimate \( \pi \).
Use your <code>estimate-integral</code> to produce an estimate of \( \pi \) by
measuring the area of a unit circle.
</p>
<p>You will find it useful to have a procedure that returns a number chosen at
random from a given range.  The following <code>random-in-range</code> procedure
implements this in terms of the <code>random</code> procedure used in 
<a href="1_002e2.html#g_t1_002e2_002e6">1.2.6</a>, which returns a nonnegative number less than its
input.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF136" href="#FOOT136"><sup>136</sup></a>

Design a new <code>rand</code> procedure that is called with an argument that is
either the symbol <code>generate</code> or the symbol <code>reset</code> and behaves as
follows: <code>(rand 'generate)</code> produces a new random number; <code>((rand

<p>As we have seen, the <code>set!</code> operation enables us to model objects that
have local state.  However, this advantage comes at a price.  Our programming
language can no longer be interpreted in terms of the substitution model of
procedure application that we introduced in <a href="1_002e1.html#g_t1_002e1_002e5">1.1.5</a>.  Moreover, no
simple model with &ldquo;nice&rdquo; mathematical properties can be an adequate framework
for dealing with objects and assignment in programming languages.
</p>
<p>So long as we do not use assignments, two evaluations of the same procedure
with the same arguments will produce the same result, so that procedures can be
viewed as computing mathematical functions.  Programming without any use of
assignments, as we did throughout the first two chapters of this book, is
accordingly known as <span id="index-functional-programming"></span>
<em>functional programming</em>.
</p>
<p>To understand how assignment complicates matters, consider a simplified version
of the <code>make-withdraw</code> procedure of <a href="#g_t3_002e1_002e1">3.1.1</a> that does not
bother to check for an insufficient amount:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (make-simplified-withdraw balance)
  (lambda (amount)
    (set! balance (- balance amount))
    balance))

(define W (make-simplified-withdraw 25))

(W 20)
<i>5</i>

(W 10)
<i>-5</i>
</pre></div>

<p>Compare this procedure with the following <code>make-decrementer</code> procedure,
which does not use <code>set!</code>:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (make-decrementer balance)
  (lambda (amount)
    (- balance amount)))
</pre></div>

<p><code>Make-decrementer</code> returns a procedure that subtracts its input from a
designated amount <code>balance</code>, but there is no accumulated effect over
successive calls, as with <code>make-simplified-withdraw</code>:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define D (make-decrementer 25))

(D 20)
<i>5</i>

(D 10)
<i>15</i>
</pre></div>

<p>We can use the substitution model to explain how <code>make-decrementer</code> works.
For instance, let us analyze the evaluation of the expression
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">((make-decrementer 25) 20)
</pre></div>

<p>We first simplify the operator of the combination by substituting 25 for
<code>balance</code> in the body of <code>make-decrementer</code>.  This reduces the
expression to
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">((lambda (amount) (- 25 amount)) 20)
</pre></div>

<p>Now we apply the operator by substituting 20 for <code>amount</code> in the body of
the <code>lambda</code> expression:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(- 25 20)
</pre></div>

<p>The final answer is 5.
</p>
<p>Observe, however, what happens if we attempt a similar substitution analysis
with <code>make-simplified-withdraw</code>:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">((make-simplified-withdraw 25) 20)
</pre></div>

<p>We first simplify the operator by substituting 25 for <code>balance</code> in the
body of <code>make-simplified-withdraw</code>.  This reduces the expression
to<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF137" href="#FOOT137"><sup>137</sup></a>
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">((lambda (amount) 
   (set! balance (- 25 amount)) 25)
 20)
</pre></div>

<p>Now we apply the operator by substituting 20 for <code>amount</code> in the body of
the <code>lambda</code> expression:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(set! balance (- 25 20)) 25
</pre></div>

<p>If we adhered to the substitution model, we would have to say that the meaning
of the procedure application is to first set <code>balance</code> to 5 and then
return 25 as the value of the expression.  This gets the wrong answer.  In
order to get the correct answer, we would have to somehow distinguish the first
occurrence of <code>balance</code> (before the effect of the <code>set!</code>)  from the
second occurrence of <code>balance</code> (after the effect of the <code>set!</code>), and
the substitution model cannot do this.
</p>
<p>The trouble here is that substitution is based ultimately on the notion that
the symbols in our language are essentially names for values.  But as soon as
we introduce <code>set!</code> and the idea that the value of a variable can change,
a variable can no longer be simply a name.  Now a variable somehow refers to a
place where a value can be stored, and the value stored at this place can
change.  In <a href="3_002e2.html#g_t3_002e2">3.2</a> we will see how environments play this role of
&ldquo;place&rdquo; in our computational model.
</p>
<span id="Sameness-and-change"></span><h4 class="subsubheading">Sameness and change</h4>

<p>The issue surfacing here is more profound than the mere breakdown of a
particular model of computation.  As soon as we introduce change into our
computational models, many notions that were previously straightforward become
problematical.  Consider the concept of two things being &ldquo;the same.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Suppose we call <code>make-decrementer</code> twice with the same argument to create
two procedures:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define D1 (make-decrementer 25))
(define D2 (make-decrementer 25))
</pre></div>

<p>Are <code>D1</code> and <code>D2</code> the same?  An acceptable answer is yes, because
<code>D1</code> and <code>D2</code> have the same computational behavior&mdash;each is a
procedure that subtracts its input from 25.  In fact, <code>D1</code> could be
substituted for <code>D2</code> in any computation without changing the result.
</p>
<p>Contrast this with making two calls to <code>make-simplified-withdraw</code>:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define W1 (make-simplified-withdraw 25))
(define W2 (make-simplified-withdraw 25))
</pre></div>

<p>Are <code>W1</code> and <code>W2</code> the same?  Surely not, because calls to <code>W1</code>
and <code>W2</code> have distinct effects, as shown by the following sequence of
interactions:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(W1 20)
<i>5</i>

(W1 20)
<i>-15</i>

(W2 20)
<i>5</i>
</pre></div>

<p>Even though <code>W1</code> and <code>W2</code> are &ldquo;equal&rdquo; in the sense that they are
both created by evaluating the same expression, <code>(make-simplified-withdraw
25)</code>, it is not true that <code>W1</code> could be substituted for <code>W2</code> in any
expression without changing the result of evaluating the expression.
</p>
<p>A language that supports the concept that &ldquo;equals can be substituted for
equals&rdquo; in an expression without changing the value of the expression is said
to be <span id="index-referentially-transparent"></span>
<em>referentially transparent</em>.  Referential transparency is
violated when we include <code>set!</code> in our computer language.  This makes it
tricky to determine when we can simplify expressions by substituting equivalent
expressions.  Consequently, reasoning about programs that use assignment
becomes drastically more difficult.
</p>
<p>Once we forgo referential transparency, the notion of what it means for
computational objects to be &ldquo;the same&rdquo; becomes difficult to capture in a
formal way.  Indeed, the meaning of &ldquo;same&rdquo; in the real world that our
programs model is hardly clear in itself.  In general, we can determine that
two apparently identical objects are indeed &ldquo;the same one&rdquo; only by modifying
one object and then observing whether the other object has changed in the same
way.  But how can we tell if an object has &ldquo;changed&rdquo; other than by observing
the &ldquo;same&rdquo; object twice and seeing whether some property of the object
differs from one observation to the next?  Thus, we cannot determine &ldquo;change&rdquo;
without some <em>a priori</em> notion of &ldquo;sameness,&rdquo; and we cannot determine
sameness without observing the effects of change.
</p>
<p>As an example of how this issue arises in programming, consider the situation
where Peter and Paul have a bank account with $100 in it.  There is a
substantial difference between modeling this as
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define peter-acc (make-account 100))
(define paul-acc (make-account 100))
</pre></div>

<p>and modeling it as
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define peter-acc (make-account 100))
(define paul-acc peter-acc)
</pre></div>

<p>In the first situation, the two bank accounts are distinct.  Transactions made
by Peter will not affect Paul&rsquo;s account, and vice versa.  In the second
situation, however, we have defined <code>paul-acc</code> to be <em>the same thing</em>
as <code>peter-acc</code>.  In effect, Peter and Paul now have a joint bank account,
and if Peter makes a withdrawal from <code>peter-acc</code> Paul will observe less
money in <code>paul-acc</code>.  These two similar but distinct situations can cause
confusion in building computational models.  With the shared account, in
particular, it can be especially confusing that there is one object (the bank
account) that has two different names (<code>peter-acc</code> and <code>paul-acc</code>);
if we are searching for all the places in our program where <code>paul-acc</code> can
be changed, we must remember to look also at things that change
<code>peter-acc</code>.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF138" href="#FOOT138"><sup>138</sup></a>
</p>
<p>With reference to the above remarks on &ldquo;sameness&rdquo; and &ldquo;change,&rdquo; observe
that if Peter and Paul could only examine their bank balances, and could not
perform operations that changed the balance, then the issue of whether the two
accounts are distinct would be moot.  In general, so long as we never modify
data objects, we can regard a compound data object to be precisely the totality
of its pieces.  For example, a rational number is determined by giving its
numerator and its denominator.  But this view is no longer valid in the
presence of change, where a compound data object has an &ldquo;identity&rdquo; that is
something different from the pieces of which it is composed.  A bank account is
still &ldquo;the same&rdquo; bank account even if we change the balance by making a
withdrawal; conversely, we could have two different bank accounts with the same
state information.  This complication is a consequence, not of our programming
language, but of our perception of a bank account as an object.  We do not, for
example, ordinarily regard a rational number as a changeable object with
identity, such that we could change the numerator and still have &ldquo;the same&rdquo;
rational number.
</p>
<span id="Pitfalls-of-imperative-programming"></span><h4 class="subsubheading">Pitfalls of imperative programming</h4>

<p>In contrast to functional programming, programming that makes extensive use of
assignment is known as <span id="index-imperative-programming"></span>
<em>imperative programming</em>.  In addition to
raising complications about computational models, programs written in
imperative style are susceptible to bugs that cannot occur in functional
programs.  For example, recall the iterative factorial program from 
<a href="1_002e2.html#g_t1_002e2_002e1">1.2.1</a>:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (factorial n)
  (define (iter product counter)
    (if (&gt; counter n)
        product
        (iter (* counter product)
              (+ counter 1))))
  (iter 1 1))
</pre></div>

<p>Instead of passing arguments in the internal iterative loop, we could adopt a
more imperative style by using explicit assignment to update the values of the
variables <code>product</code> and <code>counter</code>:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (factorial n)
  (let ((product 1)
        (counter 1))
    (define (iter)
      (if (&gt; counter n)
          product
          (begin (set! product (* counter 
                                  product))
                 (set! counter (+ counter 1))
                 (iter))))
    (iter)))
</pre></div>

<p>This does not change the results produced by the program, but it does introduce
a subtle trap.  How do we decide the order of the assignments?  As it happens,
the program is correct as written.  But writing the assignments in the opposite
order
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(set! counter (+ counter 1))
(set! product (* counter product))
</pre></div>

<p>would have produced a different, incorrect result.  In general, programming
with assignment forces us to carefully consider the relative orders of the
assignments to make sure that each statement is using the correct version of
the variables that have been changed.  This issue simply does not arise in
functional programs.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF139" href="#FOOT139"><sup>139</sup></a>
</p>
<p>The complexity of imperative programs becomes even worse if we consider
applications in which several processes execute concurrently.  We will return
to this in <a href="3_002e4.html#g_t3_002e4">3.4</a>.  First, however, we will address the issue of
providing a computational model for expressions that involve assignment, and

integers.  Chapter 3 of <a href="References.html#Knuth-1981">Knuth 1981</a> includes an extensive discussion of
techniques for generating sequences of random numbers and establishing their

assignments.  (<a href="References.html#Steele-1977">Steele 1977</a> debunks this argument.)  Alternatively it may
reflect a view that step-by-step assignment is easier for beginners to
